<small>A CHANCE MEETING</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;DO you mean to take me for a spy?&#8221;</p>

<p>I had hard work to prevent myself laughing
at the man to his face; and it is no light matter
to laugh at these self-satisfied, bullying officials
in Russian Poland. Some of them have too much
power.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I understand that you refuse to answer my
questions and shew me your papers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what if I do?&#8221; He had burst into my
room in the little inn at Bratinsk as I sat reading
my paper over a cigar, and without any preface
had fired his questions at me with the peremptory
incivility of the average police agent. My temper
had taken the intrusion badly.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows.
&#8220;I am a police agent from Warsaw and
must know your business in Bratinsk.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that I saw light. I recalled a paragraph I
had just read in the Warsaw paper. I pointed to
it. &#8220;Is this the key to your visit?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, you have read it,&#8221; he replied with that offensive
manner in which these people always contrive
to imply that everything you say or do is a
matter of suspicion.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll read it again now with more interest,&#8221; said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
I. I did so very deliberately, to gain time to cool
my temper and see how it could possibly affect me.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are in a position to state that a raid was
made two nights ago upon a house in the Kronplatz,
which has long been suspected to be the Warsaw
headquarters of a branch of the dangerous
patriotic society known as the &#8216;P.F.F.&#8217; (Polish
Freedom Fraternity). The house was deserted at
the time, but important papers were found which
revealed the existence of a conspiracy of wide and
far-reaching extent. The complete break-up of the
powerful organization of the Freedom Fraternity
is likely to be the result of the raid, and several well-known
patriots are said to be implicated by the
discoveries. Among the names rumoured is that of
Count Peter Valdemar, once well known as the
&#8216;Stormy Petrel&#8217; of Polish politics.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you take me for Count Peter Valdemar?&#8221;
I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not come here to be fooled,&#8221; was the angry
reply. &#8220;If you will not comply with my demands,
you must accompany me to Warsaw.&#8221;</p>

<p>I saw the prudence of not angering him. &#8220;I am
Robert Anstruther, an Englishman, and have been
here about three weeks, shooting over the estate
of my friend, Count Ladislas Tuleski.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your passport?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here it is. You have a very unpleasant manner,&#8221;
I could not help adding, as I took out my
pocket book. By a curious chance I had three passports;
my own and that of my chum, Robert Garrett<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
and his sister, Margaret. They were to have
come out with me on their way to Turkey, but had
been prevented at the last moment. I picked mine
out and handed it to him. &#8220;It&#8217;s properly vis&eacute;d,
you&#8217;ll see.&#8221;</p>

<p>He assumed a very profound air as he read it.
&#8220;You speak Polish very well for an Englishman,&#8221;
he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I speak also German and French, and some
Russian.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have no trace of the vile English accent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that meant for a compliment?&#8221; I asked
lightly. It was no use to get angry again.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you are a friend of Count Ladislas Tuleski?
You are, no doubt, aware that he is a suspect.&#8221;</p>

<p>I smiled as I thought of my friend&#8217;s airy impulsiveness
and almost butterfly repudiation of responsibility.
&#8220;I am surprised he should be suspected
of doing anything seriously.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is,&#8221; was the snappy reply. &#8220;And his
friends are naturally objects of interest just now.
Where is he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. I heard of him last in London.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you are from London? It is at least a
coincidence. Do you know Count Peter Valdemar?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe I met him once.&#8221; I remembered that
I had seen him at my friend&#8217;s hotel in London.</p>

<p>&#8220;Another coincidence,&#8221; he returned drily. There
was a pause during which he regarded me fixedly,
pretty much as though I were a criminal. &#8220;You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
would perhaps, like to shew me all your papers, to
satisfy me of the truth of your story.&#8221;</p>

<p>That was what an American would call &#8220;the
limit.&#8221;</p>

<p>I got up and opened the door. &#8220;I have told you
the truth and I don&#8217;t allow any man to question
my word. You&#8217;d better go before I lose my temper.&#8221;</p>

<p>I stood six feet without bootheels; I had been
the heaviest number five in my college eight that
Corpus had had for years; and was in the pink of
condition. He saw that I meant business and rose.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t question your word,&#8221; he began.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going?&#8221;</p>

<p>He went out into the corridor. &#8220;We shall probably
require you to come to Warsaw.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you wish to arrest me do it, and be hanged
to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t talk like that, and had better leave
Bratinsk. So long as you stay here you will be
under surveillance&mdash;&#8221; the rest of his sentence was
lost, for I slammed the door in his face.</p>

<p>The attempt at any kind of surveillance over my
movements would drive me out of Bratinsk like a
shot; and I should have been much more annoyed
by the incident but for the fact that I had been
daily expecting my visit to be brought to a close
by the weather. I had been very lucky to hit such
an open season; but it was late in December, and
the snow was so long overdue that by leaving at
once I should miss very little sport.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>I determined to go, therefore. I had a pig-sticking
fixed for the following day; and that should
be the last.</p>

<p>It was not at all unlikely, too, that Warsaw would
afford me some excitement. The papers were full
of hints about impending troubles from the strikers
and revolutionary party, consequent upon the ominous
unrest in St. Petersburg; and I settled that
I might as well go there for a couple of days to see
the fun, and then rush home for Christmas.</p>

<p>With this plan in my thoughts I strolled up to
the railway station to see about trains.</p>

<p>As I reached the building the stationmaster, a
very busy little official, named Blauben, came running
up to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, mister, mister,&#8221;&mdash;he knew this one word
of English and thought it the correct way to address
an Englishman&mdash;&#8220;you can do me a service.
I beg of you. I am in sore perplexity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the matter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A country-woman of yours. She sets me at
defiance and does not understand a word I say.
The last train for three hours has gone and the
law is that I shut the station. She will not go
out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you want me to put her out for you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no; you can explain to her that the law
requires the station to be shut now; and they are
very strict because of this last conspiracy they have
discovered. No one is allowed to remain, mister.
Besides, my wife is waiting for me; and you know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
her. She is not patient when the dinner is kept
waiting. Ah, mister?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is she?&#8221;</p>

<p>I pictured to myself a typical strong-minded
British matron, or spinster, stern of feature, sturdy
of will, Baedeker in hand, insistent upon her rights,
and holding the station grimly against the chattering
officious little Pole; and I looked for some fun.
But, instead, he led me up to a girl, who contradicted
in every particular my anticipation. She was
some twenty years of age, well-dressed and as pretty
as a painting; straight, regular features, flaxen hair
and blue eyes; glorious eyes meant for laughter,
but now clouded with trouble and nervous agitation.
A picture of pale, shrinking misery that went
straight to my heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here is an English mister who will explain,&#8221;
said the stationmaster with elaborate gesture.</p>

<p>I raised my hat and as she glanced at me, the
colour flushed into her cheeks and her large eyes
seemed to dilate with a new fear connected with
my presence. In a moment it flashed into my
thoughts that she had understood him quite well.</p>

<p>&#8220;The stationmaster tells me you are a country-woman
of mine,&#8221; I said in English; &#8220;and has asked
me to explain that the station is to be closed now.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a pause, her look one of blank dismay.
She bit her lip and then stammered slowly with a
rich foreign accent, &#8220;Zank you, sir; I cannot go.
I wait for ze train and zomeone.&#8221;</p>

<p>I accepted this as though it were the purest English<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
and gave a free translation of it to the station
master. But he was bluntness itself. His wife
was waiting for him, and he had the law on his
side.</p>

<p>I turned to the girl again and said, trying German
this time: &#8220;They have curious laws in this
country, and one of them requires the station to be
closed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her face lighted with unmistakable relief and she
answered in the same language: &#8220;My servant has
gone to make some arrangements, I only wish to
wait for a train.&#8221;</p>

<p>I interpreted this also; but the man was obdurate.
&#8220;She cannot wait here. No one is allowed&mdash;by
law.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I <i>must</i> wait,&#8221; she broke in, and blushed
vividly and trembled at having given away the fact
that she understood him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me offer a suggestion. I am an Englishman,
Robert Anstruther, and if you will permit, I
will wait with you outside until your servant returns.
These officials are obstinate just now because
of some plot that has been discovered; and he will
only send for the police if you do not comply.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the mention of the police she rose quickly, all
the colour left her face and her lips quivered.</p>

<p>The stationmaster beamed his thanks upon me
as he bowed us out and turned the key upon us.</p>

<p>&#8220;These little officials are very touchy,&#8221; I said,
when we stood outside and I saw she was quite
undecided what to do.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>She paused, and then said impulsively: &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know what you will think. I&mdash;I am so ashamed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope not. There is no need.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean about&mdash;I am not English.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you not? You answered me in English,&#8221;
I said gravely.</p>

<p>A little blush signalled vexation. &#8220;As if you
did not know. It is no subject for laughter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God forbid that I should laugh. You are too
evidently in deep trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you know that I understood him all the
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>I bowed. &#8220;I ask no questions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should like to explain, but I cannot. Oh, how
humiliating!&#8221; she cried, and the distress and trouble
in her tone touched me deeply.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am only a stranger, but if I can help you, I
beg you to give me the opportunity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You cannot. You cannot; oh, I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She
left the sentence unfinished and turned away to
stare along the road leading to the village, her arm
resting upon a gate near. &#8220;If he comes back&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
I heard her murmur; but the rest of the sentence
was lost.</p>

<p>She was a mystery, and a very fascinating mystery
too. Who could she be? Why travelling
alone? What was her trouble? Why pretending
to be English? Why had she started so at the mention
of the police? These and a dozen other questions
rushed into my mind in the minute or two
that followed. I cudgelled my wits for something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
to say; some way of breaking down the barrier that
prevented her making some kind of use of me.</p>

<p>The visit of the police agent having turned my
thoughts to the subject of the conspiracy, I wondered
whether she could be in any way connected
with it. A fugitive, perhaps? But the idea was
preposterous. She was surely the very incarnation
of innocence; about as well fitted for a conspirator
as I was for a police agent.</p>

<p>She turned suddenly and broke in upon my
thoughts by saying, hurriedly and nervously, this
time in Polish: &#8220;Thank you, sir, for what you have
done and also for your offer; but I must not detain
you longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>I smiled. &#8220;You are not detaining me; but I will
go, of course, if you wish.&#8221;</p>

<p>She hesitated. I hoped it was from reluctance
to dismiss me. Then she put out her hand impulsively
and said with an air of constraint and a very
wistful look: &#8220;My secret is safe with you, I know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should like to make it a condition of silence
that you let me help you further.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no. That is impossible; impossible,&#8221; she
cried quickly. &#8220;My&mdash;my servant will be back
soon.&#8221; The fear in her eyes increased as she spoke
of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t forget the name&mdash;Anstruther. I&#8217;m
at the <i>Petersburg Inn</i>, should you&mdash;or your friends
think me likely to be of any use.&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head. &#8220;No, no. Thank you.
Thank you.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>I raised my hat and turned away. I would have
given a lot to be able to find some excuse for staying
with her; and when I looked after her, chance
found me a reason to go back. She was walking
slowly in the direction of the village, her back towards
me, and I saw her handkerchief fall.</p>

<p>I picked it up and hurried after her. Hearing
my step she turned so quickly as to suggest alarm.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have dropped this,&#8221; I said, handing her
the little dainty lace trifle. As I held it out the
initials &#8220;V.D.&#8221; embroidered in the corner, lay uppermost.</p>

<p>She took it hurriedly, glanced from the initials
to my face, and then thanked me.</p>

<p>Just then a man came hastily round a bend in
the path some twenty paces ahead of us. She bit
her lip at sight of him and her nervous confusion
increased.</p>

<p>&#8220;My&mdash;my servant. You must go, please.&#8221;</p>

<p>Surprised that she should shew such fear of a
servant, I drew aside with a smile and she walked
on.</p>

<p>Then I looked at the servant; and the mystery
about her at once became clearer and yet deeper.</p>

<p>It is one of the freaks of my otherwise treacherous
memory, never to forget a face; and despite his disguise
I recognized the man at once. I knew him
by his remarkable eyes&mdash;small, piercing and almost
black in hue.</p>

<p>It was Count Peter Valdemar, the &#8220;Stormy
Petrel&#8221; of Polish politics; the originator of a dozen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
conspiracies. He was dressed as a servant, wore a
close-cropped red wig, and was clean shaven.</p>

<p>I recalled the police agent&#8217;s words instantly; and
the danger to the girl appealed to me. For her sake
I resolved to warn him.</p>

<p>They spoke together, and from his glances in my
direction, I guessed she was telling him what I had
done. As I approached them, he assumed the deferential
air of a servant.</p>

<p>&#8220;A word with you,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>He was full of surprise. &#8220;With me, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>I drew him aside. &#8220;I have no desire to pry into
your affairs, but I wish to warn you that you are
in great danger of discovery here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Danger! Of what? Surely you are mistaken,
sir?&#8221; He spoke with a flourish of the hand and a
bow, but his piercing eyes were fixed intently upon
mine.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am a friend of Count Ladislas Tuleski, and I
met you once or twice in his rooms in London a
year ago. You are Count Peter Valdemar. This
morning a police agent from Warsaw visited me,
and regarded me as a suspect because of my friendship
with the Count, and because I admitted that I
had known you. Take the warning from me as a
friend; and be on your guard. If I have recognized
you, others may.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was safer for us both not to be seen together,
so I walked off leaving him a very much surprised
Count indeed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br />


<small>ON THE DEVIL&#8217;S STAIRCASE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">I &nbsp;HAD not walked three hundred yards towards
the village when I met the police agent hurrying
stationwards at a pace which would quickly
bring him face to face with Count Peter and his
companion.</p>

<p>This must be prevented at any cost, so I stopped
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish to speak to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They told me you had gone to the station.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was all right, for it showed he was following
me. &#8220;Our interview ended hastily this morning
because I thought you doubted my word and I
was angry. I see now that you were doing your
duty. Come back with me to the inn, and let us
talk things over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can say what you have to say here,&#8221; he
answered. He was a surly dog: but I dared not
let him pass me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Scarcely that; because I can adopt your suggestion
and prove to you, by letters and so forth,
that I am what I told you; an Englishman and not
a spy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you change like this?&#8221; His suspicious
tone again.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>&#8220;The reason is simple. I have decided to leave
here to-morrow probably, and don&#8217;t wish to be
bothered by your spies meanwhile. It is simpler
to convince you with proofs.&#8221; I linked my arm in
his. &#8220;Come along, we must understand one another
better. I am not the suspicious individual
you think and you are no doubt a better fellow than
I deemed.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was a little beast, only fit to be kicked; but I
thought of the girl and smothered my natural inclinations.</p>

<p>By the time we reached my rooms I had worked
some of his suspicions loose; and when I laid before
him letters from my sister and friends at home, and
showed him such things as my cheque book, letter
of credit, and so on, he was sufficiently satisfied to
have a bottle of wine with me.</p>

<p>Over this his tongue was loosened and we discussed
the conspiracy, which he admitted was widespread
and in some respects more dangerous than
any which had threatened the Empire for years.
Its especial danger lay in the skill with which the
leaders had attempted to blend industrial discontent
with political intrigue; and so form a union
among vast masses of the population in many industrial
cities.</p>

<p>The practical grievances of the workers and the
many wrongs of the rural population were being
used by the democratic theorists, the dreamers and
the political agitators to foment discontent; and I
knew enough of Russia to be aware that such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
highly inflammable materials as these might easily
be heaped together and then fanned into one huge
simultaneous explosion all over the Empire, terrible
enough to startle the world.</p>

<p>In Russian Poland the cause was the old one&mdash;national
independence; and it was in this that Count
Peter Valdemar had taken a part and that my friend
Ladislas was involved.</p>

<p>I repeated my surprise that my friend should be
regarded as dangerous.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is a leader; and at such times any man may
be a source of danger,&#8221; was the reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;And this Count Peter&mdash;where is he?&#8221; I asked
casually.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is probably making for the German frontier,
with the intention of flying to England. He was at
Warsaw; but disappeared. Your country has much
to answer for in harbouring all these plotters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If it comes to that we have a few anarchists of
our own, and they are harboured on this side of
the Channel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not in Russia. But I don&#8217;t think the Count
will escape us this time. He is well known to so
many of us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if you catch him?&#8221; A significant smile
answered me and a tilt of the eyebrows.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have a wonderful police system,&#8221; said I,
admiringly.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall catch him on the frontier, sir. Make
no mistake. No man can get through the net we
have spread there.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>I emptied my glass. &#8220;Well, here&#8217;s luck to all
who deserve it. And now, about myself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will communicate with Warsaw; and meantime
go where you will or stay here if you
prefer.&#8221;</p>

<p>I had succeeded in detaining him nearly a couple
of hours, and by this time the Count and his companion
ought to be out of the place; so I ordered
my horse, resolved to go for a ride to test the truth
of the little beggar&#8217;s assurance that I was not to be
watched.</p>

<p>I chose the southern road and as the ground was
very hard I went at a leisurely pace. I was not
followed; and as soon as I had satisfied myself of
this, my thoughts slipped back to the incident at the
railway station, and a pair of blue eyes that had
looked with such desolate wistfulness into mine.
Would the Count get away? Had they gone already?
Would chance ever bring us together
again? Could I not do something on my own account
to help chance? That was more my way;
and I set to work thinking how I could use my
friendship with Ladislas to accomplish my end.</p>

<p>I was still following this train of thought when I
reached the hill known locally as the &#8220;Devil&#8217;s Staircase.&#8221;
Bratinsk stands on a plateau; and about five
miles to the south, this hill, one of the most dangerous
I have ever seen on account of its fearful
gradient and deadly twists and turns, leads to
the plains below. From the top there is a fine view
over the Batak Levels, a stretch of fertile country<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
extending for miles to the foot-hills beyond. It was
a favourite spot of mine and on reaching it now I
dismounted, tethered my horse near and strolled to
smoke a cigar and continue my reverie.</p>

<p>I was inclined to shake hands with myself at the
thought of using Ladislas. He would surely be able
to tell me enough of Count Valdemar to put me on
the track; and I was just thinking how to describe
the girl whose initials I believed to be &#8220;V. D.&#8221;
when I caught the grating of wheels, followed rapidly
by the throbbing sound of horses&#8217; feet.</p>

<p>Some one must be in a deuce of a hurry, I thought,
as I looked back along the road. Some one was,
surely enough. Not a couple of hundred yards
from the brink of the hill came a light caleche with
two occupants drawn by a pair of horses at full
gallop. What was the fool of a driver about? To
dash down the Devil&#8217;s Staircase at that mad pace
meant death. No horses ever foaled could make the
sharp turns and twists of that zigzag, treacherous,
deadly incline at a gallop.</p>

<p>I shouted a warning at the top of my voice; and
then my heart seemed to leap in my breast and
every vein in my body to chill like ice as the occupants
of the caleche looked up, and I recognized
Count Peter Valdemar and the girl who had been
in my thoughts all that day.</p>

<p>As the runaways reached me I leapt down on to
the road and I made a spring for the reins of the
horse nearest me. I missed them and was rolled
over and over, while the frightened beasts dashed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
on, the Count tearing and tugging and straining at
the reins in a futile effort to stop them.</p>

<p>I jumped up and ran down the hill in pursuit.
Just below, the road made an S-shaped curve, and
the horses were round this and out of sight like a
flash; and while I was racing after them round the
first bend, I heard a shout in a man&#8217;s voice, a girl&#8217;s
scream, and then the crashing sound of a smash.</p>

<p>I reached the scene in a few moments. The wreck
had come at a point where the road turned at less
than a right angle; and the sight of it sickened me
with fear.</p>

<p>One horse was down, lying against a bank, bleeding
profusely and kicking spasmodically in what I
judged to be a death struggle. The other was on
its feet and was plunging and tugging to free itself
from the reins and harness which had got entangled
in the wreck of the caleche. Under the body of the
vehicle lay the Count, and as I did not for the moment
see his companion, I guessed that she must
be hidden under the wreckage too.</p>

<p>With a big effort I hoisted the vehicle sufficiently
to drag out the Count; but the girl was not there.</p>

<p>Then I saw her lying behind a bush by the roadside.
I ran to her and laid my finger on her pulse.
With intense relief I found the beat; feeble it is
true, but steady; and I poured some brandy into the
cup of my flask and managed to get a little of it
between her lips. A trembling sigh escaped her;
and I returned to the Count.</p>

<p>The police agent was right. The Count would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
never cross the German frontier&mdash;he had crossed
the farther one. I knew enough of first aid work
to ascertain the cause. His neck was broken; and
I guessed he had been thrown sideways on to his
head, snapping the vertebrae. I drew the body to
the side of the road and threw one of the rugs
over it.</p>

<p>Next I freed the sound horse&mdash;thinking he might
be needed&mdash;soothed him a bit and tethered him to a
tree.</p>

<p>By this time the girl was fast recovering and I
went back to her. I was administering another
dose of the brandy when she opened her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;You!&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, fortunately. Don&#8217;t worry about things.
May I help you to sit up and take this, or can you
manage it alone? That&#8217;s good,&#8221; I smiled as she
sat up unaided.</p>

<p>&#8220;What has happened? Oh, I remember. The
hill and then&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; and she put her hands before
her eyes for a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have had a wonderful escape.&#8221;</p>

<p>The word confused her. &#8220;Did we escape then?
Is he not following us? My uncle thought&mdash;oh, I
understand; I thought you meant&mdash;but is he
hurt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, badly.&#8221;</p>

<p>I had placed her so that her back was towards the
wrecked carriage and the Count&#8217;s body; but at my
words she turned and looked round. Her eyes were
wide with horror. &#8220;Is he dead?&#8221; she asked.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>&#8220;But for a miracle you would have shared his
fate.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was silent for a moment and lifted her hands
and let them fall with a sigh. &#8220;He would rather
have had it so than have been captured; and he
feared that this time. He was a hard, desperate
man.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no sign of any strong emotion or
great personal grief in this reference to him. It
was far better so under the circumstances. But I
did not quite know what to say.</p>

<p>Then she surprised me. &#8220;He told me to come
to you if anything happened to him. You recognized
him, he said.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, as Count Peter Valdemar. I warned him
this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He told me. You are a friend of&mdash;Count
Ladislas Tuleski?&#8221; She said this with just a suspicion
of hesitation.</p>

<p>&#8220;An intimate friend. Do you know him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;I know him,&mdash;oh, yes: I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she hesitated,
glanced at me and stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is one of my most intimate friends and
one of the best fellows in the world,&#8221; I said enthusiastically.</p>

<p>She made no reply, but glanced swiftly at me
again and lowered her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I can walk now,&#8221; she said presently;
and I helped her to rise. &#8220;I am not hurt, you see.
It was only fright and shock.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank God it was no worse,&#8221; I cried. She did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
not seem to hear this. &#8220;Now, what do you wish
to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. What ought I to do? My
uncle&mdash;do you know the Count was my uncle?&mdash;or,
rather, not my own uncle, no real blood relation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I had no idea.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When the trouble came at Warsaw he had to
fly, and he was carrying certain papers with instructions
to friends of the Fraternity to Cracow.
A raid is expected there; and there are papers
which threaten us all. Even my own dear mother
is in danger. He told me to carry those papers
through to Cracow at any cost; to get your help
if need be, and to say that your friend, Count Ladislas,
was also involved. I was to tell you this, if
you showed any reluctance to help me. But now
what can we do?&#8221; and she looked the picture of
dismay.</p>

<p>&#8220;You were travelling as an English girl?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, as Miss Mary Smith. He got passports
for me in that name and for himself as Ivan Grubel,
my servant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has them and the rest of the papers. They
are sewn into his coat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did he make all this methodical preparation?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was recognized, I think, in Bratinsk. That
was why we were driving away. He expected to
be pursued.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>&#8220;If I get the coat, can you find the papers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but&mdash;he is&mdash;dead;&#8221; and she shuddered.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have to think of the living. Yourself, my
friend, and your mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is not a pleasant thing to strip the coat off a
dead man; but it had to be done. So I went and
did it as quickly as I could. I took it back to
her and she was hurriedly searching for the papers
when she gave a little gasp of alarm and shrank
close to me as a horseman appeared, picking his
way very gingerly down the hill. It was my friend,
the police agent from Warsaw. In a moment he
took in the scene. He recognized me at once, and
my companion a moment later.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, this is better luck than I expected. A
smash, eh? So you didn&#8217;t get far away after all?
I knew I should catch you, but didn&#8217;t hope to do it
so soon. Where&#8217;s Count Peter Valdemar?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You again, is it?&#8221; I said, with a smile. &#8220;This
young lady, a country-woman of mine, Miss Mary
Smith, has met with an accident and her servant,
named Ivan Grubel, has been killed. The horses
ran away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Killed, eh? That&#8217;s his coat then. Give that
to me.&#8221; My companion caught her breath and
clutched my arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;You guessed too fast, my friend; you did so
this morning, you know, as I showed you afterwards.
This coat is mine;&#8221; and with that I slipped
my arms into it and put it on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s easy to see it&#8217;s yours by the way it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
fits you,&#8221; he sneered. My arms were some three
inches too long for the sleeves and the body was
ridiculously short. &#8220;I know you by this time.
You must give me that coat. I saw the woman
there searching the pockets for something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you want it, you&#8217;d better come and take it.
I shan&#8217;t give it up unless you do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For your own sake don&#8217;t mix up any more with
this. If you are an Englishman, go away and leave
me to deal with this woman. But give me that
coat. You know to whom it belonged; and I must
have it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He dismounted and walked toward me.</p>

<p>&#8220;You had better keep your distance,&#8221; I said
quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You resist? Then I must do my duty. You
are my prisoner.&#8221;</p>

<p>The threat of arrest seemed to scare the girl
badly, but without a second&#8217;s hesitation she tried
to shield me by taking everything on her own
shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;I alone am responsible,&#8221; she cried, stepping
forward. &#8220;Give up the coat, Mr. Anstruther. It
is I who should be the prisoner.&#8221;</p>

<p>She acted pluckily, like the little brick she was,
and with the best intentions in the world. But it
was a huge mistake. She had practically given the
whole thing away.</p>

<p>The significant leer of triumph on the police
agent&#8217;s face made it plain that he appreciated this.</p>

<small>VOLNA DRAKONA</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">I &nbsp;LOST no time in undeceiving the police agent.
&#8220;You are plucking unshot birds,&#8221; I said.
&#8220;There is not going to be any arrest either of this
lady or myself. You can end the thing anyhow
you please, short of arresting either of us.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was glad that that made him lose his temper.
&#8220;Do you dare to disobey me?&#8221; he cried furiously.</p>

<p>I became personal and heaped fuel on the fire of
his anger. &#8220;Don&#8217;t be a foolish little person. You
don&#8217;t know how idiotic you look. You can do
nothing. You are six inches shorter than I am,
and I don&#8217;t care a kopeck for your authority as a
policeman.&#8221;</p>

<p>He swore fluently and stamped his feet with
rage. &#8220;You will answer for this,&#8221; he shouted,
using a very foul epithet. &#8220;I thought this morning
you were a spy. Now I know it. You shall
not insult me. In the name of the Czar, I call on
you to submit.&#8221;</p>

<p>I laughed at him with intentional aggravation.
&#8220;You are a worse fool than I thought. I am a
British subject; I have done no wrong; and I care
no more for your Czar than I do for you. You
have just insulted me grossly and the best thing
you can do is to clear out.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>&#8220;You are a revolutionary, in league with this
woman and the carrion there;&#8221; and he jerked his
thumb toward the dead body.</p>

<p>I took no notice of this coarseness, but untethered
the unhurt horse and led it over to my companion.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are going,&#8221; I said to him. &#8220;I have told
you that this is Miss Mary Smith; I have her passport
here in my coat.&#8221; I rummaged in the pockets,
found two passports, and handed them to him.</p>

<p>He glanced at them and then pocketed them with
a grin of self-satisfaction at his astuteness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you going?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is our own business. I will not let you
follow us. Return me those passports,&#8221; I said,
threateningly. He did not see my object but backed
away toward his horse. &#8220;Come, quick.&#8221;</p>

<p>He hesitated a moment and then mounted hurriedly.
&#8220;As they were in your coat they will connect
you with these people,&#8221; he said with a cunning
leer.</p>

<p>I did not care a rap for this now; whether he
kept or returned them. We could not possibly use
them again, so I shrugged my shoulders and
turned away. &#8220;Go to the devil,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>But he had a surprise for me. As my back was
turned a pistol shot rang out, and the horse I was
holding plunged and tore loose from me, limped
down the hill and fell to the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now we&#8217;ll see about your tall talk, Mr. Englishman.
You and the woman there will just march
on ahead of me into Bratinsk; and if either of you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
so much as look round, I&#8217;ll fire. Mind that. By
God.&#8221;</p>

<p>His weapon was levelled at my head and my
companion again showed the stuff she was made
of. With a little cry she dashed right in front of
me dead in the line of fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must not shoot,&#8221; she said, quite steadily.
&#8220;This gentleman has done nothing but help me
after the accident.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll find out all about that at Bratinsk,&#8221; replied
the man. &#8220;Now march, you two.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was an ugly situation; but I did not take the
police agent as seriously as did &#8220;Mary Smith.&#8221;
They are bullies to the core, so long as it is safe to
bully; and this fellow was a particularly brutal
brute of his brutal class.</p>

<p>There is one thing they are all afraid of, however,
the censure of their superiors; and their superiors
hate the investigation which follows when
anything happens to foreigners in general, and
Englishmen and Americans in particular.</p>

<p>I felt quite confident, therefore, that he would not
fire, and that the chief danger we ran was that his
weapon might go off by accident. Moreover, he
was probably as bad a shot as they nearly all are.
So I put up a bluff.</p>

<p>I drew my companion to one side and looking
the man square in the face I walked a couple of
paces toward him. Instead of shooting he backed
his horse and warned me again. This satisfied
me.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>&#8220;You can fire if you like. You know I am an
Englishman and if you shoot me there&#8217;ll be a
row.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do as I say,&#8221; he shouted with an oath.</p>

<p>I paused and then said very deliberately: &#8220;I&#8217;ll
see you in hell first. Fire at me if you dare.&#8221;</p>

<p>A little gasp of alarm from the girl was lost in
a volley of oaths from the police agent.</p>

<p>Then the luck veered once more to our side.
Inadvertently his spur touched his horse&#8217;s flank
and the animal, taking his loud tones as addressed
to it, began to fidget and prance so that he could
not have taken aim had he wished. The figure he
cut was quite laughable.</p>

<p>But it was my chance and I took it. I picked up
a stone and flung it at the horse. This set it kicking
and plunging desperately so that the none too
skilful rider was nearly unhorsed. Choosing my
moment I ran up, seized the hand which held the
revolver and wrenched the weapon away without
any trouble at all.</p>

<p>That was the end of the fighting so far as he was
concerned; for he drove his spurs home and clattered
away up the hill.</p>

<p>I judged that he was afraid I might now do the
shooting which he had threatened so glibly; and
mingled with his fear was the belief that, as he had
shot our horse and had thus destroyed the means of
our flight, he could safely ride off to fetch assistance.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a good riddance anyhow,&#8221; said I with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
laugh, when he had disappeared. &#8220;I think you&#8217;re
the pluckiest girl I ever knew.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was so frightened,&#8221; she declared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, so frightened that you actually put yourself
right in front of his revolver. That&#8217;s the kind
of fright I mean; only I call it pluck.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was nothing. But you should not have taken
any part in this miserable affair. You have compromised
yourself with the police and may get into
all kinds of trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think we had better start for Cracow?
That fellow won&#8217;t be away longer than he
can help, and I have to get a little scheme ready
for him before he returns. The sooner we start the
safer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what can we do about&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; and she
glanced to where the Count&#8217;s body lay.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we are to think of the living, we can do
nothing. He has been recognized and when the
police return they will care for the body and something
can be done from Warsaw.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems heartless to leave him,&#8221; she murmured
in distressed perplexity.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no other way; so if you please we will
start. I&#8217;ll tell you my plan as we walk. Your
mother&#8217;s safety is in the balance, remember.&#8221; She
yielded then and we set out.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think we shall get through without any great
trouble. There is a train from Bratinsk somewhere
about eight o&#8217;clock, which will put us in Cracow
in a few hours.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>&#8220;But I have no passport now, to pass the
frontier.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fortunately, I can arrange that. My first plan
is to send the police off on a false scent. There is
a peasant family, not a mile from the top of the hill&mdash;where
my horse is, by the way&mdash;and they will do
anything for me. I helped them out of some
trouble when I was here last year, and they think
a lot of it. With this police agent away from
Bratinsk for a few hours, we can get off secretly
and safely.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the top of the hill I found my horse, put
&#8220;Miss Smith&#8221; on his back and handed her the coat
which had been the first cause of trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall need the coat for my plan; so find the
papers which are sewn into it and be ready to rip
them out the moment we reach the cottage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you?&#8221; she protested.</p>

<p>&#8220;No protest, please. I am good for more than
a mile at fair speed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You do all this for a stranger,&#8221; she said, her
eyes lighting as she looked down at me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, we shan&#8217;t always be strangers. Keep him
going. I can&#8217;t talk and run at the same time. Be
merciful;&#8221; and with that we set off at a good
round trot. I held to the stirrup and so had no
difficulty in keeping up.</p>

<p>In about five minutes we turned off the road and
the cottage was soon in sight. By good fortune
the man I sought, Michel, was in the patch of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
garden and greeted me with a smile. I came to the
point at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;Michel, you have often asked for a chance of
repaying that little debt. You can do it now. I
want you and your sister, Testa, to help me. You
are to ride my horse and your sister yours, and
start at once. Ride down the Devil&#8217;s Staircase,
strike out any way you like at the bottom; ride for
four or five hours; you in the name of Ivan Grubel,
your sister as Mary Smith, an English girl. At
the end of the ride, which must be as near a railway
station as you can manage, turn my horse
adrift to go where he will; and then make your
way home secretly. And no one must know of
your absence. You&#8217;ll do this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why yes, Excellency. Testa, Testa;&#8221; and he
ran in calling his sister.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now for the coat? It will be the best possible
thing to create the false trail with.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The papers are here in the lining.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get them out then at once, please. We have
no minutes to lose.&#8221; I handed her a knife and she
found them.</p>

<p>Michel came round the cottage a minute later
leading the horse for his sister just as Testa herself
appeared ready to start.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-evening, Excellency,&#8221; she said, her brown
eyes dancing at the thought of an adventure.</p>

<p>&#8220;You grow stronger every day, Testa, and
prettier,&#8221; I said. &#8220;Now, Michel, wear this coat,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
take care that every one has a full view of it; and
when you get rid of the horse, strap it on his back.
Mind, you two, my liberty may depend upon you.
God-speed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Trust me,&#8221; replied Michel as he mounted.</p>

<p>I helped Testa to the saddle. &#8220;Don&#8217;t look
scared, child,&#8221; I said; for her face had clouded at
my words. &#8220;I shall be in no danger if you do this
thing well. Off with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By the help of the Virgin,&#8221; returned Testa;
and away they went helter-skelter towards the
Devil&#8217;s Staircase.</p>

<p>As soon as they were out of sight we set off for
Bratinsk, across the fields; and I explained the
next part of my plan. This was to use the two
passports of Bob Garrett and his sister.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not told you my real name,&#8221; said my
companion.</p>

<p>&#8220;We scarcely seem to have had time to speak
of anything yet. We&#8217;ve been pretty busy, you
see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is Volna Drakona. My father is dead; my
dear mother is in feeble health. I have a half-brother
and half-sister&mdash;Paul and Katinka.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The passports will give you another sort of
brother till we get to Cracow. Only for a few
hours, however, if all goes well. Volna! I have
never heard that name before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is my mother&#8217;s&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she said simply.
Then, &#8220;You like it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is southern in its sweetness.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>&#8220;My mother is from the South. Do you think
I could write to her and let her know that all is
well with me? She may hear of my uncle&#8217;s death,
and the anxiety will almost kill her. We are deeply
attached to one another.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no reason why you should not. And
from Cracow it may be safe to telegraph.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You speak as if we were quite certain of getting
through.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why shouldn&#8217;t we? I have had another
thought. My servant is at Bratinsk and I shall use
him to create another scent for the police. I shall
send him off toward Warsaw in my name while
we go to Cracow as the two Garretts. I look for
no trouble in Bratinsk. The police agent is not
likely to think we shall venture to return there. I
expect he will just get the help he needs and rattle
back to make the arrest. He will then follow
Michel and his sister; and as this will take up some
hours at least, we ought to be clear away and near
Cracow before he even returns to Bratinsk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You make it seem very simple and easy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So it ought to be; but I shall feel better when
we are in the train speeding west. There is one
thing, by-the-by, you had better make some kind
of change in your appearance. I can do it easily
by shaving my beard and changing my clothes. Do
you think you could buy something in Bratinsk?
Your description is sure to be telegraphed in all
directions.&#8221;</p>

<p>We discussed the means of doing this and had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
scarcely settled matters when we reached Bratinsk.
Having arranged where to meet, I went to the inn
and Volna to procure the change of costume.</p>

<p>The dusk was beginning to fall and deeming it
best to be cautious, I entered the inn by a side door
and succeeded in slipping up to my rooms unnoticed.</p>

<p>My servant, Felsen, was not there; but afraid to
lose time in waiting, and unwilling to risk asking
for him, I set to work and shaved off my beard and
moustache. As I changed my clothes, I found the
police agent&#8217;s revolver; and took it with me.</p>

<p>As Felsen always looked after my things I did
not notice anything amiss, except that he seemed to
keep them very carelessly; but as soon as I went
into the sitting room, which opened from the bedroom,
I scented trouble.</p>

<p>Every drawer and cupboard in the place had been
ransacked, and papers and books were all left in the
greatest confusion.</p>

<p>The reason was plain. It was the result of a
police visit. My friend of the Devil&#8217;s Staircase
had set his comrades to work. Instinctively I ran
back into the bedroom and destroyed the evidences
of my shaving operation, and was in the act of
leaving the room when I heard voices approaching
it.</p>

<p>I had barely time to step into a cupboard when
the door was opened and two men entered. One
was Felsen, the other a stranger. His curt, sharp
tone and manner suggested the police.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>They passed through into the sitting room
beyond.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your master has not been back then, it
seems?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t think he&#8217;ll come back after what
you say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll probably be brought back.&#8221; This with a
sneer. &#8220;We know how to deal with spies and
traitors.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a pause and then Felsen said: &#8220;I
suppose if he&#8217;s caught he won&#8217;t be let out for a
long while.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Our prison doors only open one way easily,&#8221;
chuckled the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I may as well look after myself, I
suppose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. He&#8217;s evidently made a fool of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s my turn now. Have a cigar?&#8221;</p>

<p>I heard matches struck and smelt my best cigars.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can wait downstairs as well as here,&#8221; said
the police agent. &#8220;I&#8217;ll lock the doors this time to
make sure.&#8221; He came into the bedroom, locked the
door on the inside and then went back. The other
door was then locked and the two men went downstairs.</p>

<p>Fortunately he had left the key in the bedroom
door, and the instant the way was clear, I went out,
crept along the corridor and down the back stairway
to the door by which I had entered.</p>

<p>I gained the street safely and walked away toward
the railway station, trusting to the gloom of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
the evening and my shaven face to save me from
recognition.</p>

<p>By the action of the police and the fact that they
were already on the look-out for me had crumpled
up my plan. And there was still worse to come.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br />


<small>A HORSEDEALING TRANSACTION</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AS I hurried to the station I tried to think over
the position coolly and carefully.</p>

<p>In the first place, I was now a fugitive from the
police; but as I had done no wrong, the fact had a
sort of fascination for me. The scent of adventure
and the prospective excitement attracted me, and
the idea of a trial of wits with the authorities roused
every combative instinct in my nature.</p>

<p>Even had there been no one else involved, I
should have gone through with the thing for its
own sake. But there was Volna. Her safety and
that of her mother depended upon me; and that
fact was the most powerful incentive I could have
had to urge me to my utmost effort. The thought
of helping such a splendid girl was just a sheer
delight.</p>

<p>Those papers had to be got to Cracow. The
mother&#8217;s safety required this; and the risk involved
in the attempt formed the spice of the adventure.
I had powerful and influential friends both at home
and on the continent who would readily help me to
get out of any bother so far as matters had gone at
present; but it might be a very difficult thing if in
the present excited state of the empire, I was caught
helping the &#8220;P.F.F.&#8221; by carrying seditious documents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
for revolutionary purposes. Volna also had
run no great risk as yet. The mere fact that she
was travelling with Count Peter Valdemar was not
by itself likely to involve her in any serious consequences.
If the papers could have been destroyed,
therefore, we could easily have put an end to the
complication. But this was impossible. Their
delivery in Cracow was imperative.</p>

<p>We stood thus at the dividing line between safety
and risk; and there was nothing for it but to go
through with the matter to the end.</p>

<p>My experience at the inn had its lesson. I
recognized that I must move very warily indeed
in making any inquiries at the station. The fussy
little stationmaster, Blauben, might recognize me
despite the change in my appearance; and I did
not at all relish the prospect of interviewing
him.</p>

<p>But in this one respect the luck was with me. I
was surprised to see a small crowd of people at the
generally deserted station, and it was an easy
matter to mingle with them without being observed.</p>

<p>That was all the luck there was, however, as the
reason for the crowd spelt further disaster to my
plans of escape. The place was in a hubbub of excitement;
and I soon learnt that there had been a
very serious accident on the line at a place called
Pulta, some seven or eight miles west of Bratinsk.</p>

<p>As a result of this the line to Cracow was blocked.
There would be no train going west that night.</p>

<p>The people in the station were travellers from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
the opposite direction who had been put out and
told, with the usual courtesy of the railway authorities,
that they must shift for themselves until the
line was clear. They might think themselves lucky,
I overheard little Blauben tell one man, if they got
on by noon the following day.</p>

<p>This was check with a vengeance; if not checkmate.</p>

<p>I hung about for some time with the object of
ascertaining the chance of getting a train in the
other direction&mdash;anything to get out of Bratinsk&mdash;and
was pretending to study one of the time bills
when I caught my own name.</p>

<p>&#8220;Know the Englishman, Anstruther? Of course
I do.&#8221; It was Blauben&#8217;s voice. &#8220;If he comes here,
I&#8217;ll stop him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We think he may try and bolt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s he going to bolt? There&#8217;s no train
west and nothing east except the midnight express.
But what&#8217;s it all about?&#8221; The reply was given in
low tone and escaped me. But part of the stationmaster&#8217;s
answer was enough.</p>

<p>&#8220;Spy? Rubbish. Why he was here shooting
last year. You people would find spies growing on
gooseberry bushes. No. I have already told a
hundred of you that there will be no train&#8221;&mdash;this
to a questioner in a tone of exasperation; and I
saw him hurry off gesticulating frantically. I could
do no good by waiting longer, so I slipped out of
the station, and went back to the village to meet
Volna.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>After all, the accident at Pulta might not prove
an unmitigated evil. The few sentences I had overheard
showed that the police were watching the
station for me; and an attempt to leave would
probably have landed us right into their hands.</p>

<p>Then it occurred to me that we might even turn
the accident to good account. If we could get to
Pulta soon, we could give an excellent reason for
our presence; that we wished to inquire about some
friend supposed to have been in the wrecked train;
and, as the line from there to Cracow would be
open, we could do the journey after all by rail.</p>

<p>Pulta by the road was some ten miles, and a
rough hilly road it was. Too far and too rough
for Volna to attempt to walk. To hire any kind of
conveyance was of course out of the question; as
it would lay a trail which even a blind policeman
could follow. I had a spare horse at the inn; but
for the same reason I dared not attempt to take it
out of the stable.</p>

<p>In that part of Poland, however, one deal can
always be made without exciting any comment or
surprise. Any one will trade a horse with you, and
at any time of the day or night. I believe a man
would not be in the least surprised to be called out
of bed at midnight for the purpose; and I am sure
he would gladly get up for the sheer pleasure of
the deal. It is the one great pastime, or as near to
a pastime, as the older men of that district care to
get.</p>

<p>But to obtain a saddle was another matter; while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
even to have asked for such a thing as a side saddle
would have stirred enough curiosity to set the
gossips&#8217; tongues click-clacking all over the village.
There was nothing for it therefore except that
Volna should ride bare-back; and as I should have
to lead her horse, there was no use in getting one
for myself.</p>

<p>Volna was waiting for me when I reached the
appointed place. She had made a considerable
change in her appearance. A long fur cloak
covered her dress, and in place of her former dainty
headgear she was wearing a close fur turban.</p>

<p>Wishing to try the effect of my own altered
appearance, I assumed a sort of slouching walk and
made as if to pass her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you think I should not know you?&#8221; she
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was rather hoping you would not. I am
supposed to be disguised.&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed. &#8220;I should know you anywhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we must trust that other eyes are not so
keen as yours,&#8221; said I, feeling a little crestfallen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Or that they are not so interested in recognizing
you. What about the train?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;None but bad news;&#8221; and I told her what had
occurred and how I proposed to manage. She
agreed at once, but was for walking.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I can walk ten miles,&#8221; she declared
readily.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no need. It is a rough, hilly road;
and there is a man at the other end of the village<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
from whom I can buy a horse without any chance
of rousing suspicions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would not be more hilly for me than for you,
would it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you had better have the horse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I will say no more,&#8221; she agreed. &#8220;I am
afraid my disguise is not much more successful
than yours,&#8221; she added, as we walked on.</p>

<p>&#8220;It might have been awkward if neither had
recognized the other, mightn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hadn&#8217;t thought of that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You would have to hide your face, if you don&#8217;t
want to be known.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I expect I look an awful fright.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The more disguised you are the better,&#8221; said
I. She laughed. &#8220;It is good to hear you laugh
in the midst of all&mdash;this uncertainty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It cannot be so very dreadful if you can manage
to pay such neat compliments Mr.&mdash;Anstruther.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You find that name a bit troublesome, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think you are worth taking some
trouble for? But it <i>is</i> hard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lucky that I&#8217;m going to change it while we
are together.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Change it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll talk that all over on the road to Pulta.
Here&#8217;s the place where I hope to get the horse. It
may take a little time. Will you wait for me?&#8221;</p>

<p>There is a rough kind of recognized procedure
in horsedealing in that district; but as I had had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
more than one experience of the kind I knew how
to act.</p>

<p>I crossed to the house and seeing a light in the
stable behind, guessed I should find the man bedding
his horses. He did not know me, but I had
heard of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-evening, Andreas,&#8221; I said in a rather
surly tone, as if I had a grievance against him; and
without another word I walked up to the four
horses one after the other and looked them over.
He took no notice, but went on forking the bedding.
This was all strictly in accordance with etiquette.</p>

<p>I came out of the last stall shrugging my
shoulders and laughing contemptuously. &#8220;Blauben
is a little fool. He said I should find some horses
here. Good-night. There isn&#8217;t one worth a couple
of roubles.&#8221;</p>

<p>The last sentence he understood to mean that I
might possibly deal. He dashed his fork on the
ground and came toward me, saying very angrily:
&#8220;What&#8217;s that? Who are you? Who sent you
here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Old Blauben at the station.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And do you think you know anything about
horses? You don&#8217;t know even how to look at
them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a chestnut that&#8217;s worth the whole string.
I thought there was something to buy here. I
suppose he thought I wanted meat for a bouillon
factory. Good-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait, there, wait, you long imp of ignorance.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
Do you want to make a match with your chestnut?
Where is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>I laughed. &#8220;If these crocks of yours saw mine
they&#8217;d learn how to move. Here, smoke, you old
owner of dogs&#8217; meat;&#8221; and I handed him a cigar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Holy Virgin, what do I hear?&#8221; he cried,
throwing up his hands, and putting a lantern near
my face. He knew well enough now that I had
come to trade; and was happy. But we kept up the
farce a little longer; he abusing my chestnut and I
his four nags.</p>

<p>His next object was to find out which horse I had
selected; but I kept this from him carefully. At
length I pointed to one that I would not have had
as a gift.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to give my dogs a treat one day, I
think they could manage with that. How much
for it, if I give you back the hide and the feet?&#8221;</p>

<p>He grinned. &#8220;You know a fine horse when you
see one, after all,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You shall have him&mdash;three
hundred roubles.&#8221; About &pound;30 this.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kopecks, you mean. Good-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait, wait. Was there ever such an impatient
fool as you? Do you really want him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, only I didn&#8217;t want this long walk for
nothing: and I&#8217;m taking some horses to Noshti
Fair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t there one of the others you&#8217;d care for?
Don&#8217;t be in a hurry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m in no hurry. What about these others?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the real bargaining began. He put a price<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
on the horse I wished to have; and we chaffered
and smoked and swore and abused one another in
the way these bargains are made. I dared not
hurry the matter too much. He would boast all
over the village the next day of the fool who had
given him the price he asked; and the transaction
would become public property, with the result that
the police might get wind of it.</p>

<p>It was safer to waste the time necessary to drive
a hard bargain. And so we wrangled until I had
fought the amount down to a fair price, when we
spent another ten minutes squabbling whether he
should give me an old bridle or merely a rope
halter.</p>

<p>When I had gained my point and was riding the
horse away he swore so violently that he was a
heavy loser by the deal, that I knew he had made
enough profit to boast about. I thought it best to
alter his opinion, therefore.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know the history of this horse?&#8221; I
asked knowingly. &#8220;No, you can&#8217;t or you&#8217;d know
that I&#8217;ve cheated you. Do you know that he came
from General Kolwich&#8217;s stable and was sold for
four hundred roubles? I should have paid that for
him, had you pressed me. I shall get five for him.
But you should learn to know a horse when you see
one.&#8221;</p>

<p>He pushed his cap back and scratched his head,
and invoked the name of the Deity in a despair
that was almost pathetic.</p>

<p>I rode off with a chuckle. I knew that I had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
struck deep into his pride as a horse trader, and
that he would now keep his lips as close as a rat
trap about the whole transaction. He would brood
over it, and wait for the day when he could get
even with me; but though the skies fell, he would
never speak of that horse again to any one.</p>

<p>The bargaining had taken nearly an hour, and I
feared the sands of Volna&#8217;s patience would be running
out fast.</p>

<p>She greeted me with a sigh of relief. &#8220;I had
begun to fear all sorts of things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have never had to buy a horse in these
parts. It&#8217;s an acquired art and can only be accomplished
with many lies and much time. But we&#8217;ll
be off now. You can manage to ride bare-back,
I hope?&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled. &#8220;I have ridden bare-back ever since
I was a child.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you haven&#8217;t had time yet to forget.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that a reflection on my youth or another
compliment?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about the truth, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m nearly one and twenty,&#8221; she declared with
a delightful air of dignity.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a great age,&#8221; I agreed. &#8220;I remember how
I felt at the time. One is never so old again, they
say, until quite late in life.&#8221;</p>

<p>I helped her to mount. &#8220;Bare-back riding is a
little undignified for one and twenty, I&#8217;m afraid.
Now we are really off and in our new characters.
Do you know who you are?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>&#8220;Miss Margaret Garrett, an English girl who
is very troubled what to do with the r&#8217;s in her
name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We can alter that. My friend always calls
his sister Peg.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Peg! what a woodeny name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Short for Peggy&mdash;we think that rather pretty.&#8221;</p>

<p>She repeated it several times and laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you laugh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have queer notions of what is pretty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mine&#8217;s worse, I&#8217;m called Bob.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bob! Yes, that is much worse. Bob. Bob.
Bob. It&#8217;s very short, and easy; but it&#8217;s very
funny.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My sister always calls me Bob&mdash;every one does,
in fact.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have a sister then. What is her name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sylvia.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now that <i>is</i> a pretty name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not always. She gets called Silly, sometimes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s monstrous. Is she angry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a bit. You see these are really pet names.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; She was silent a moment, and then
said: &#8220;And are we to be Bob and Peggy to one
another?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess so, except when we quarrel. Then it
will be Robert and Margaret. But it will only be
until to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To-morrow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When we reach Cracow, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall we get there to-morrow?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>&#8220;We ought to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right&mdash;Bob.&#8221; She said it with a sly little
laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll soon get used to it, Peggy. And now
I&#8217;ll get you to carry my heavy coat, and if you&#8217;ll
shake him up we&#8217;ll trot for a bit. The sooner we&#8217;ve
put a mile or two between us and Bratinsk the
better.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br />


<small>AT PULTA</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WE kept up a fair pace for nearly an hour,
the horse moving at a slow, loping canter,
with spells of walking for me to recover breath;
and in this way we covered six or seven miles,
which brought us to the foot of the steep rugged
hills that divide Bratinsk from Pulta.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve about a mile and a half climb here, then
a stretch of a mile or so along the top, and after
that a tremendous hill down into Pulta,&#8221; I told
&#8220;Peggy,&#8221; as we pulled up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you not tired?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I could cover a lot of ground at that jog
trot. I&#8217;m pretty tough, you see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ride up the hill and let me walk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a bit of it. We&#8217;ll push on as we are, if
you don&#8217;t mind.&#8221; I had no breath left for talking,
so I plodded on in silence. There had been so much
to do in the interval since we had left the Devil&#8217;s
Staircase that I seemed to have had no time to think
of anything except the pressing affair of the moment.
But I had time now, as I strode up the hill;
and for the first time I seemed to awake to a recognition
of the supreme confidence and unquestioning
trust which Volna showed in me.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>The night was very dark; we were miles from
everywhere; she knew nothing of me, and had only
seen me first some eight or nine hours before; and
yet she rode by my side as contentedly as though
we had been friends for life, and were just out for a
sort of conventional picnic in conventional hours.
The pluck of it appealed to me as much as anything.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a wonderful girl, Peggy,&#8221; I exclaimed
involuntarily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Peggy? Do you know, I think I begin to like
that name. I have been saying it over and over
to myself during the ride. But why am I wonderful?
I wish I could get used to saying Bob. But
I have a sort of something in the throat that seems
to jump up and stop me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, that&#8217;s a spasm of the naming tissues. One
only has it when a name is fresh. You&#8217;ll get over
that. The best cure is to say it often.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it, Bob? But why am I wonderful?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You do this unconventional thing as though
it were the most ordinary thing in the world!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean I oughtn&#8217;t to trust&mdash;my brother
Bob? You see, I just can&#8217;t help myself. I had
to trust you. Besides, if you knew&#8221;&mdash;she broke
off, and after a pause added a little eagerly&mdash;&#8220;you
understand, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand that chance has given me a very
delightful sister.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, didn&#8217;t you begin by keeping my secret
from that stationmaster&mdash;about Mary Smith. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
felt like&mdash;like nothing I ever felt before when he
brought you up and said you were English.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You tried your best to speak English.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was like&mdash;like a glorious dream come true
when you looked so grave and answered me in
German. I&#8217;m not used to having people do kind
things for me, except my dear mother. And when
we stood outside the station, I&mdash;well, I&#8217;d have given
anything just to have unloaded my whole stock of
trouble to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor Peggy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not Peggy, she hasn&#8217;t any troubles of that
sort yet. They are&mdash;Bob&#8217;s. But it&#8217;s poor Volna;
and Peggy will soon be Volna again.&#8221;</p>

<p>I did not know how to answer this. There was
such a touch of sadness in it: so I said nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;May I tell you?&#8221; she asked presently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sylvia always tells me hers; so I know how to
keep a secret.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you I had a half-sister and brother, didn&#8217;t
I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are they like you at all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no. They are both members of this terrible
Fraternity&mdash;revolutionaries. My father was one
and lost his life in the cause. My uncle, Count
Peter&mdash;he was the brother of my father&#8217;s first wife&mdash;has
always dominated our family: even my poor
dear mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is she involved with the Fraternity, too?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, and yet yes. She has no sympathy with
the movement at all; but my uncle influenced her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
and she has given large sums of money. She is
rich, you know, and, if it is found out, the government
would be glad to get any pretext for confiscating
her fortune. They would throw her into
prison, and it would kill her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But surely your uncle was not so mad as to
leave anything implicating her in existence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I could think that. It may be so; but
only this morning he warned me that if these papers
did not get to Cracow and a raid was made there,
things would be found which would place her in
danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>I thought some things about Count Peter which
I did not express. &#8220;I hope he was exaggerating
matters,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have not been happy at home because I
would never join in any of these miserable conspiracies.
My sister Katinka, and Paul too, always
upbraided me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You put your sister first, I notice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She influences Paul. She is very strong willed,
and very&mdash;very zealous for the &#8216;Fraternity.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think <i>you</i> would make a very formidable
conspirator, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not that, exactly. I am too much of a
coward, I know. But mother&#8217;s fortune comes to
me and&mdash;oh, this miserable money; they want it for
the cause.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Phew!&#8221; I whistled. &#8220;I begin to understand.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>&#8220;You thought it strange, I expect, that I was so
little affected by my uncle&#8217;s fate; but I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say any more if it worries you,&#8221; I said
when she paused.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I must tell you; only&mdash;the fact is, I was
always afraid of him and he brought me away from
home this time, saying only that I was to go on a
visit to some friends; but when we were near Bratinsk
he told me what the real object was and&mdash;and
that mother and he had agreed that I was to be
married.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Married!&#8221; I exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Married to a man who is high up in the Fraternity,
and that I should not go back home until&mdash;until
that was done.&#8221;</p>

<p>I thought more things about Count Peter&mdash;stronger
and harsher things too, this time.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had not heard this an hour before you saw
me at the station.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No wonder you looked troubled.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I stayed there hoping to get a train back to
Warsaw. I meant to run away. There is another
reason, a terrible entanglement, which made me so
eager to get back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Involving you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ll tell you all about it some time. It
closely concerns my mother&#8217;s safety, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What brought your uncle to Bratinsk?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Affairs of the Fraternity; to consult with one
of the leaders.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>&#8220;Well, I won&#8217;t say all I think of your uncle for
having involved you in all this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is dead. Perhaps if he had not been killed
he would have listened to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps!&#8221; But I had my own opinion. &#8220;You
are right. Volna has had her troubles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I could not feel so sorry for him as I should, if&mdash;if
things had been different. I am glad I have
told you. It&#8217;s such a relief to have told some one.
And now you know all about me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you manage to write to your mother from
Bratinsk?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, just a short note&mdash;that all was well with
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We must try to keep it so, too. Here we are
at the top of the hill. Now we&#8217;ll push along again:
and then, the first train for Cracow.&#8221;</p>

<p>We soon covered the flat along the top and I
pointed out to her the twinkling lights of Pulta below
us.</p>

<p>&#8220;How quickly we&#8217;ve come,&#8221; she cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must have a straight story to tell. I shall
say we are driving in from Vashtic&mdash;a place on the
other side of Pulta&mdash;and that our carriage broke
down and we had to continue the journey in this
fashion. I shall ask whether Mr. Trevor, a tall fair
man, was in the train at the time of the wreck.
But you&#8217;ll leave the lies for Bob to tell of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How bluntly you put it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, we can&#8217;t help telling some. But it&#8217;s in a
good cause; so we must hope they&#8217;ll pass as white
ones.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>I began to understand that night that artistic
lying is really a very difficult accomplishment, when
inquisitive officials have to be satisfied.</p>

<p>I found the railway station at Pulta in the hands
of the police. It had been taken into custody so to
speak. When anything happens in Russian Poland,
it immediately becomes an object of suspicion; and
any one seeking information is at once suspected of
complicity. An officer stopped us and asked in a
peremptory manner: &#8220;Who are you and what do
you want?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There has been an accident, I believe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you and what do you want? Answer.&#8221;
A little more sharpness in the tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am an Englishman, Robert Garrett, and this
is my sister. We wish to know whether a friend,
Mr. James Trevor, of London, has been hurt in the
accident!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What accident?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The accident to the Cracow express!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who told you there had been an accident?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard it at Vashtic.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who told you there had been an accident?&#8221; he
repeated.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seemed to be generally known. The servants
in the house where I was staying heard it
somewhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are the servants&#8217; names?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. I think the man who told me was
called Paul. But what I want to know&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where were you staying at Vashtic?&#8221; he interrupted.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>&#8220;What can that matter. Mr. Trevor of London&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! You refuse to answer?&#8221; He turned away
and beckoned to a companion, with whom he conferred,
nodding toward us. Then turned to me
again. &#8220;How did you get here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I started in a caleche but the wheel came off
and we had to finish the journey in this fashion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which wheel?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The left hind wheel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whose carriage was it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hired it from Gorlas Malstrom.&#8221; My inventive
faculty for names was getting strained.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where does he live?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At Vashtic close to the hotel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which hotel?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Imperial.&#8221; I remembered the name of a
place where I once had lunch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you staying there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not going back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How long were you there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not more than an hour or two.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where were you before?&#8221;</p>

<p>My local geography not being strong enough to
stand a fusillade of this kind, I threw up an earthwork
of anger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, do you want me to give you a
history of my tour with all particulars of my hotel
bills since I left London?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, you refuse to answer,&#8221; he said again, stolidly
regarding me with a gloomy stare of suspicion.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>&#8220;Oh, no; but I&#8217;ve had enough of your impertinent
curiosity. I am an Englishman, let me see
your superior officer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go away,&#8221; he said curtly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I demand to see&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go away; or you will be arrested.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then I had an inspiration. I said, with a show
of great indignation: &#8220;Very well. I&#8217;ll go, and
what&#8217;s more I&#8217;ll go by the first train to Cracow and
lay the matter before the British Consul. When is
the first train? You&#8217;ll see whether you can smash
up English travellers in your infernal trains and
then refuse their friends any information.&#8221;</p>

<p>This appeared to make an impression. He hesitated,
spoke to his companion, and then said: &#8220;Come
back in the morning. There is no train until eleven
o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>

<p>I had gained the information I needed; but I
kept up my pretence of anger, muttering and grumbling
and mumbling about what the British Consul
would do, and so on, as I turned the horse&#8217;s head
and moved off.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bad luck again,&#8221; I whispered to Volna. &#8220;No
train to-night. You may as well try to get a night&#8217;s
rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a dark wood that has no clearing,&#8221; she said
cheerily. &#8220;You need rest too, I am sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>We went off to find a hotel: and presently Volna
whispered: &#8220;One of the men is following us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The best thing we can do is to make use of him,
then,&#8221; said I; and I halted to let him come up. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
was the companion of the man who had questioned
me, and I resolved to try a different method with
him.</p>

<p>I took out a gold piece and let him see it. &#8220;You
have been told off to follow me, I suppose?&#8221;</p>

<p>He glanced at the money and thought I was going
to bribe him. &#8220;I have only my duty to do,&#8221; he
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ll be guide instead of follower and show
me where my sister and I can get rooms, I&#8217;ll give
you this.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was my man instantly. &#8220;There will be no
difficulty about that. The accident on the line has
filled up the place, but I can manage it for you.
You are English?&#8221; he said, as we walked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I only wanted to see if my poor friend, Trevor,
was in that smash. But you heard what passed?&#8221;</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders and grinned. &#8220;You
did not ask in the right way;&#8221; and he glanced at
the money I had given him. &#8220;To-morrow it will
be all right. There is a train to Cracow at eleven
o&#8217;clock. I shall be there. No Englishman was
hurt in the accident. You may feel quite at ease.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad to hear that,&#8221; I said. I was; but not
for the reasons he thought.</p>

<p>He earned his gold piece; for he soon found
accommodation for us and for the horse; and bade
us good-night, repeating his assurances that all
would be well in the morning.</p>

<small>VERY SISTERLY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">VOLNA was down before me the next morning
waiting in a little room where we had had
supper.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guessed Bob would be tired so I would not
have him called,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I have been up an
hour or more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Peggy, how is she?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hungry. And breakfast is ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You slept well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When I had stopped thinking. I couldn&#8217;t help
it,&#8221; she said in answer to my shake of the head. &#8220;I
was saying my lesson over and over, lest I should
forget it. Do you know it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lesson?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All the names you mentioned so glibly last night
at the station.&#8221;</p>

<p>I laughed. &#8220;Oh, we shan&#8217;t need to remember.
We shan&#8217;t have any more bother. That man&#8217;s
hint as to how to ask questions will carry us through.
You&#8217;ll see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we must be quick, it&#8217;s nearly ten o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve half an hour. And we&#8217;re developing a
knack of doing a good deal in half an hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I shall be a little afraid of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>&#8220;You tell them so readily.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, that&#8217;s Bob Garrett. Don&#8217;t worry about
him. He won&#8217;t tell them to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think that for a pair of dangerous conspirators
we keep up our spirits capitally.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t be able to without you. I don&#8217;t
know what I should have done, indeed, nor how to
thank you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t a man be a brute who didn&#8217;t do his
best to look after his sister?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You make light of everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you can thank me at about six or seven
o&#8217;clock this evening. We shall be in Cracow then,
and the papers will be out of our hands and off our
minds.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And after that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove. I don&#8217;t know. I haven&#8217;t thought
about that. One thing at a time and&mdash;Cracow
first. We must go.&#8221;</p>

<p>We walked up to the station and found a most
welcome change in the attitude of the police. Our
friend of the preceding night was looking out for
us, and he had evidently let it be known that there
were gold pieces to be earned. Everybody received
us with smiles. Even the man who had acted the
inquisitor&#8217;s part overnight came up and was almost
profuse in his apologies.</p>

<p>He had not known that I was an English milord;
my appearance at that time and in such a way had
aroused curiosity; duty compelled them all to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
suspicious; there were dangerous people about; I
had probably heard of the discovered plot; and so
on.</p>

<p>I understood. I took out some gold coins and
fingered them carelessly. His eyes lighted with
greed as he gazed at them.</p>

<p>&#8220;About the accident?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;There has been a bad accident; but no one of
the name of Trevor, no Englishman at all, was in
the train. I have made a special investigation,&#8221; he
added insinuatingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry to have given you the trouble; but
thank you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is no trouble, only a pleasure to be of some
small service to an English milord.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am greatly relieved,&#8221; I said. &#8220;You will
probably have had to pay some one for the work.
Permit me to repay you;&#8221; and I gave him a fifty
rouble note. His good will was cheap at a five
pound note; but he seemed amazed at so generous
a tip. His face beamed as he pocketed it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Really it is not necessary,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If I can
be of any further assistance, pray tell me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My sister and I were thinking of going to
Cracow,&#8221; I said indifferently. &#8220;Is the line safe, do
you think?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You still wish to see the British Consul there?&#8221;
This with just a shade of anxiety.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dear no&mdash;unless it is to express my high
opinion of the courtesy shown me here. Last night
is forgotten. I quite understand.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>&#8220;The train will start at eleven. It is usual&mdash;a
mere form of course in your case&mdash;to ask for passports
when issuing tickets for stations beyond the
frontier.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here they are;&#8221; and I took them out of my
pocket book making sure that he should see there
was plenty of money in it. &#8220;Robert Garrett and
Margaret Garrett, my sister.&#8221;</p>

<p>He just glanced at them and with a bow to Volna,
returned them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I show you where to get your tickets?&#8221;
He was making everything delightfully smooth for
us.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose we shall reach Cracow by about
four?&#8221; I asked casually, as I took out my cigar
case.</p>

<p>&#8220;Scarcely that, I fear. The traffic is disorganized
and the direct line has been closed. You will
travel by way of Bratinsk and change there; and
then go round by the loop which joins the main line
again at Solden.&#8221;</p>

<p>The ill news was so unexpected that it caught me
right off my guard. To go to Bratinsk meant walking
right into the hands of the men who were hunting
for us.</p>

<p>To cover my sudden confusion, I let my cigar
case fall, and as the official stooped to pick it up, I
caught Volna&#8217;s look of dire dismay, and shot her a
warning glance.</p>

<p>&#8220;You smoke of course,&#8221; I said to him, and as we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
lit our cigars, I was thinking how on earth to get
out of the difficulty.</p>

<p>Then Volna gave another proof of her quick-wittedness.
&#8220;Ought you to smoke just yet, Bob?&#8221;
she asked in a snappy sisterly tone. &#8220;You know
what the doctor said about your heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>I took the cue. &#8220;You&#8217;re always interfering,
Peggy,&#8221; I said, very testily. &#8220;I wish you
wouldn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>The police official affected not to hear this little
interchange of family amenities and discreetly
looked away.</p>

<p>&#8220;I only do it for your good,&#8221; she rapped back,
with a great air of superiority. &#8220;You complained
of that feeling, you know. But please yourself.
You always do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rubbish. It&#8217;s only because you know I want
to go and you want to stay.&#8221; She shrugged her
shoulders and turned away.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you are going, the time is close,&#8221; said the
official.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I am going;&#8221; and I scowled at Volna
and took out some money. &#8220;Where do we get the
tickets?&#8221;</p>

<p>He was turning to show me when I let the coins
fall and the cigar drop from my lips as I pressed
one hand to my heart&mdash;which, by the way, was as
sound as a bell&mdash;and clutched him with the other
for support.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew it by the look about your eyes. I saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
it coming,&#8221; said Volna, unsympathetically, as she
stooped to pick up the money, and the man helped
me to a seat. &#8220;You <i>will</i> do these things. Please
lay him straight down and get him some water, or
better, a drop of brandy.&#8221; She took off my hat
and fanned me with her handkerchief. &#8220;It&#8217;s
nothing serious,&#8221; she said to the others who came
round. &#8220;He&#8217;ll be better in a moment. Thank
you,&#8221; this to the man who came back with the
brandy. &#8220;Give him air, please.&#8221; She was most
business-like and sisterly&mdash;as though I had been
in the habit of fainting daily and she of restoring
me.</p>

<p>I came round, of course; but not until the train
had left and the question of our return to Bratinsk
was settled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you are satisfied now,&#8221; I said to Volna
most ungraciously, as I sat up.</p>

<p>&#8220;How absurd you are, Bob. I didn&#8217;t give you
the cigar.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When is the next train?&#8221; I asked the official.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not until to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There you are,&#8221; I said to Volna with a brotherly
readiness to put all the blame on her. &#8220;What
now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This gentleman said there was some fine
scenery here; and a ride or drive would do you
good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Scenery!&#8221; I cried with a fine contempt.
&#8220;Well, I suppose we can&#8217;t sit about the station all
day. But do as you please;&#8221; and she walked out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
of the station. I could have laughed at the excellent
affectation of sisterly discontent.</p>

<p>The police official sympathized with me&mdash;it was
I who had tipped him&mdash;and expressed his feeling
with a deprecating smile and shrug and a lifting
of the brows.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose it&#8217;s the only thing to do,&#8221; I murmured
as I rose.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is perhaps for the best after all that you did
not catch the train. There is you baggage,&#8221; he
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Baggage?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Remembering what you said last night about
the accident to your carriage on the way from
Vashtic, and thinking you might need the baggage
in it, I sent out this morning to have it brought
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you? That&#8217;s really very friendly and
obliging,&#8221; I managed to answer quite cordially,
while wishing him at the devil for his interference.</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall we do with it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, just keep it at the station here till I come
back for that evening train. You&#8217;ll know it easily.
Two leather portmanteaus; one marked &#8216;R. G.&#8217;
and one &#8216;M. G.,&#8217; London. I&#8217;ll go and tell my sister.
She&#8217;ll be as delighted as I am at your thoughtfulness.
It was only that which made her wish to
remain here for the day.&#8221;</p>

<p>I went after Volna, who was walking toward the
little town.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>&#8220;That&#8217;s a nice thoughtful fellow. He has sent
out some one to find our luggage in the broken-down
trap and bring it in. I told him how glad
you&#8217;d be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Should I go back and thank him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s necessary, you can do that
when we get back this evening. We are going for
a ride now&mdash;and the sooner we&#8217;re off the better.&#8221;
I went to the stable where my horse was, thinking
how to get over the rather awkward difficulty of
securing a second animal.</p>

<p>I did not intend to return to Pulta; and if I
hired the horse I should not be able to return it.
To buy it might create suspicion, as a man does
not purchase a horse merely to go for a ride&mdash;even
in that horse-bartering region; and I had no wish
to turn horse-thief.</p>

<p>I put a bold face on the matter and went into
the stable whistling. An ostler was grooming my
horse and the owner of the place looking on.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a nice looking animal of yours,&#8221; he
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; and as good as he looks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt. Andreas knows a good horse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Andreas? Who&#8217;s he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At Bratinsk. Where you got him, I suppose.&#8221;</p>

<p>I scented danger and fenced. &#8220;I suppose you
know most of the horses round about here. Will
you smoke?&#8221; And I gave him a cigar.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know this one. I sold him to Andreas.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you? Well, I don&#8217;t care anything about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
Andreas, but I know he&#8217;s a good horse and I
want to hire one as good for my sister to ride
to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can find you one. There he stands.&#8221; I had
a look at him. A good horse I saw at a glance.
&#8220;I like his looks,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>The ostler took him out and ran him up and
down. Then an idea occurred to me, involving
some of the white lies of necessity however. I
expressed a very exaggerated admiration.</p>

<p>&#8220;Carry a lady?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Carry a baby,&#8221; was the reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I tell you what I&#8217;ll do if you&#8217;ll agree.
We&#8217;re going to Cracow for a couple of days and
coming back; and when we come back we shall
want two horses. I&#8217;ll buy him from you if you
can find me a couple of saddles, and if we can come
to terms for your taking care of both the horses
while we stay here.&#8221;</p>

<p>It did not take very long to conclude the bargain,
and Volna and I were soon mounted.</p>

<p>Just as we were starting my friend of the police
came up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Going for the ride then?&#8221; he asked knowingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes. By the way, has that luggage of mine
come in yet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. They ought to have been back long
before now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a nuisance. My sister has to do without
her habit.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>&#8220;She looks very charming,&#8221; he replied, with a
bow.</p>

<p>&#8220;What time must we be back for that train?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Six o&#8217;clock. But why not ride to Solden, it&#8217;s
not more than twenty miles or so. You could take
the train there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no. We&#8217;re going the other way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you ever coming, Bob?&#8221; asked Volna,
sharply.</p>

<p>He stepped aside with another significant shrug
of the shoulders and with a laugh I rode off.</p>

<p>&#8220;You do the vinegary sister to the life,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was cause then. I caught sight of that
police agent from Bratinsk in the distance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove!&#8221; I exclaimed; and we clattered off
through the narrow streets and as soon as we were
clear of the town gave our horses their heads.</p>

<small>THE LUCK TURNS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">VOLNA was thoroughly at home in the saddle,
and it was easy to see that she had been
accustomed to horses all her life. She had a perfect
seat; and that firm hand and control which
bring out the best there is in a horse and make him
understand that the master is up.</p>

<p>It was delightful to watch her; and as we kept
at it in that first rattling stretch, I believe that in
the sheer exhilaration of the ride, we forgot everything,
even the unwelcome appearance of the police
agent from Bratinsk.</p>

<p>But neither the pace nor the oblivion could last
for ever, and when we drew rein at the foot of a
hill we came back to a recollection of the load of
our worries.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t that glorious?&#8221; she cried, her cheeks
glowing, and her eyes shining, as she stretched
forward and patted her horse&#8217;s neck.</p>

<p>&#8220;You ride magnificently. How you would
enjoy a run with the hounds in England!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have read about it. I love horses. I can
keep in the saddle all day. I have done it at home.&#8221;
Then her face clouded. &#8220;How selfish! I had almost
forgotten,&#8221; she added.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>&#8220;We are doing all we can,&#8221; I replied. &#8220;Are you
sure that the man you saw was that police agent?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Could I forget him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t think he saw us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. He was talking very earnestly to some one.
But I recognized him instantly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d give something to know what brought him
to Pulta.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was following us, surely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We must hope not. If Michel did his work
properly, my horse with your uncle&#8217;s coat will have
been found a good many miles on the other side of
Bratinsk; and his men should be hunting for
us there. But I can&#8217;t say I like the look of the
thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall we do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d better try and think what he&#8217;ll do. I
had intended to take the hint which the man at
Pulta dropped, to ride to Solden, and take the train
from there. But if the other man picks up our
trail there, he&#8217;ll set the wires going and we shall
find some one waiting for us at Solden.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How far is it to Cracow? Could we ride all
the way? I could ride all day and all night too, if
necessary, as long as the horses will last out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t know the road. I don&#8217;t even know
where we are now. When you saw that man, I just
rattled off at hazard. I know Cracow is pretty well
west of Pulta, a little bit south too, and I guess
we are on the right road. I am accustomed to take
long rides and besides having a fairly good bump of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
location, always carry this;&#8221; and I showed her a
small compass on my watch chain.</p>

<p>&#8220;I always ride by the sun, but then I know the
country round Warsaw for ever so many miles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We should be in a pretty pickle if we were
lost,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;The pickle would be much hotter if it was a
police preserve.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove, it would. And the worst of it is that
if that fellow hears of us at Pulta, he&#8217;ll know the
names we&#8217;ve taken.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor Bob, I&#8217;m getting him into very troubled
waters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not Bob or Peggy I&#8217;m thinking of, it&#8217;s
Volna, and Volna&#8217;s mother. Cracow seems a
mighty hard place to reach; but I&#8217;m going to get
there somehow.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was silent for a while thinking over the problem.
Volna&#8217;s suggestion was the best if we could do it&mdash;to
ride all the way to Cracow. But it was no light
undertaking. If I had known the way, I should not
have hesitated; but the days were short and
although the sun was shining brightly enough then,
the weather looked as though it were going to
change. It was warmer; and when a spell of frost
breaks in that country, it generally indicates that
rain or snow is coming. To be lost in a rain or
snow storm would be a very ugly development indeed.</p>

<p>There was moreover the awkward question
whether we were likely to be pursued. On the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
other hand to stop at Solden appeared to be even
more risky.</p>

<p>Seeing me thus thoughtful, Volna broke in.
&#8220;You are not going to keep anything from me, are
you. Don&#8217;t do that, please? Do you think that
man is likely to ride after us from Pulta?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was just in my mind. I should say it will
depend upon how soon he learns anything about us.
He is more likely to trust to the wires.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s getting very exciting. He may telegraph
ahead and have people sent out to stop us. I suppose
I ought not to say so, but I am beginning to
feel a sort of keen enjoyment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have made up my mind. We&#8217;ll stick to the
horses and avoid the trains. But we&#8217;ll try and
mislead any one who may follow us.&#8221;</p>

<p>We had already passed several people on the road.
I stopped the next comer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is this the road to Solden?&#8221; I asked the man,
evidently a farmer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, one of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Straight road?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As straight as roads are in these parts,&#8221; he
replied, with a grin.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean do I have to turn to the left or right?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be turning most of the time. You&#8217;re
from Pulta, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not where I&#8217;m from but where I&#8217;m going
that concerns me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right. I know the lady&#8217;s horse;&#8221; and on he
drove without any more.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>&#8220;Everybody seems to know everybody else&#8217;s
horse about here,&#8221; I said. &#8220;If it weren&#8217;t awkward
it would be comical. We&#8217;ll ride on and try the next
man.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next was another farmer. A surly Russian
who understood Polish with difficulty and spoke it
unintelligibly. So I thanked him and rode on no
wiser.</p>

<p>Three or four miles later brought us to a village.</p>

<p>&#8220;Had we not better get some food here?&#8221; asked
Volna. &#8220;I will go and buy it, and perhaps can find
out at the same time what road we ought to take.&#8221;
So we dismounted, and I waited with the horses.</p>

<p>Presently a priest came by, and bade me good-day
with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have a picturesque place here, Father,&#8221; I
said. &#8220;What is it called?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Kervatje,&#8221; he answered, and we began to talk.
I learnt that his name was Father Ambrose, and
after some while he asked, &#8220;You are a foreigner?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An Englishman. My sister is with me. We
were going to Solden, but I fear have lost the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no. Solden lies across the hills there. A
rough road but fairly direct. The only point of
difficulty is just over the brow of the hill where the
road forks. Take that to the right or you will go
astray and might find yourselves in Cracow, after
some forty miles or so, that is&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; and he smiled
pleasantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll remember what you said,&#8221; I replied, &#8220;and
am much obliged to you.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>&#8220;It is a pleasure. I have been in England; and
speak English a little. But I read much.&#8221; We
then chatted about London and the incidents of his
visit until Volna came up.</p>

<p>&#8220;My sister,&#8221; I said. As he greeted her I saw
him start and look very closely at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you do?&#8221; he said in English, to her
complete discomfiture, holding out his hand. I
read her signals of distress and sailed in to the
rescue.</p>

<p>&#8220;My sister is unfortunately dumb,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;How sad,&#8221; he exclaimed, throwing up his
hands. Then he looked puzzled. &#8220;She bears a
remarkable resemblance to a very beautiful woman
whom I knew in the long ago. Twenty years and
more. She is a Pole, and is now the Countess Drakona.
How very strange.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, these chance likenesses are very extraordinary,&#8221;
I said, gravely. &#8220;Come, Peggy, we
must get on,&#8221; I added to Volna, in English, and
put her in the saddle again.</p>

<p>&#8220;How very sad,&#8221; he repeated, mournfully.
&#8220;And yet how clever of her to be able to make herself
understood in buying things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The education of the dumb in England is almost
perfect. Signs are their language, you know,&#8221;
I replied, as I shook hands with him and mounted.</p>

<p>He looked after us very thoughtfully, and when
presently I turned, he waved his hand to me and I
saw him walk a few paces and then enter the shop
where Volna had made her purchases.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>&#8220;I think we&#8217;ll rattle on again for a bit. He&#8217;s
going to find out that yours is a singular form of
aphasia, and only affects your knowledge of English.
Perhaps he&#8217;ll class it as a case for the scientists;
but more likely as one of suspicious ignorance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who can he be?&#8221; asked Volna.</p>

<p>&#8220;He gave me his name as Father Ambrose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have heard my mother speak of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He spoke of her as a very beautiful woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And she is still beautiful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And he said how closely you resembled
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Volna laughed. &#8220;Bob mustn&#8217;t be conventional.
That&#8217;s a sort of ball-room dandy&#8217;s speech. And no
brother talks like it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Brothers don&#8217;t always say all they think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But they keep their thoughts to themselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know what I think about my sister,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>She smiled again, and glanced at me. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
you think I bought a huge parcel, Bob?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If we eat all that, it will last us farther than
Cracow. But I know what it means generally, when
a girl goes shopping.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, she thinks of things that are necessary.
There are loaves in there for the horses.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never thought of them,&#8221; I admitted.</p>

<p>&#8220;One of us must think sensibly,&#8221; she retorted.</p>

<p>&#8220;True for you. But did you find out anything
about the road to Solden?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. A woman served me, and she knew nothing.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>&#8220;Well, I found out from the priest. At the top
of the hill yonder the road forks and that to the
left will take us to Cracow, forty miles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder what he is thinking now he knows I
am no mute.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Men make all sorts of mistakes, and I shouldn&#8217;t
be in the least surprised if he believes we are just&mdash;running
away together.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bob! How ridiculous!&#8221; she cried, with a
merry laugh, her cheeks aflush. &#8220;Let us get on;&#8221;
and she shook the reins, and dashed on ahead from
me.</p>

<p>When we reached the forked roads at the top of
the hill I glanced at my watch. It was nearly half-past
three, and we had still forty miles to cover on
an unknown road; it had taken us some three hours
to do about twenty miles in daylight with the horses
fresh&mdash;how long would they take to finish the journey
mostly in the dark? I shook my head dubiously
over the sum.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll ride on a couple of miles or so and then
find a spot for our picnic; but we can&#8217;t spare more
than half an hour at the outside.&#8221;</p>

<p>Black bread, sausage, and village cheese do not
make an epicurean lunch; but Volna and I had rich
hunger sauce, and were more than satisfied. We
fed the horses while we were eating, to save time,
and in half an hour we were ready for the road
again. There was no longer any doubt that the
weather was going to change. As we mounted
there were very ominous banks of dark sullen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
clouds. Rain or snow would fall within a few
hours: but I could only hope it would be rain.</p>

<p>&#8220;I fancy we&#8217;ve shaken off any pursuit even if
any one started out to follow us,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are going to have some weather, too, that
will help us. I hope Bob doesn&#8217;t mind riding in
the wet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You guessed the thought in my mind, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I&#8217;m used to reading weather signs. The
rain never hurts me. I&#8217;ve been out for hours in it.
But we shan&#8217;t have much for an hour or two, you&#8217;ll
find.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d better make the most of our time then.&#8221;</p>

<p>We rode as fast as we dared push the horses in
view of the distance to be covered. I eased my
animal up the hills, and now and again took a spell
of half a mile or so on foot; but despite this, I was
concerned to find that before we had covered
another twenty miles he began to show signs of
fatigue.</p>

<p>Then the storm burst upon us. It was rain, not
snow; but rain in almost tropical force. It would
not have been so bad, had we known the road; but
we had already had to stop several times to make
sure we were going right.</p>

<p>For two hours we plodded through a pelting
storm until I was drenched and feared that Volna
must be in the same condition.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t care if I could see,&#8221; she said once.
It was pitch dark, and we could only go at a walking
pace.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t care if you were not wet,&#8221; I answered,
&#8220;though I confess I&#8217;d like to know where
we are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not very wet,&#8221; she said. &#8220;My fur cloak
protects me. We shall get somewhere in the end.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In England we have a civilized habit of putting
up sign posts,&#8221; I grumbled, as we came to another
forked road and I was at a loss which to choose.
&#8220;All the roads seem to be twins in this place.&#8221;</p>

<p>Which way to choose I could not even guess. I
tried to judge which was the better road; but both
appeared equally bad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let the horses decide,&#8221; said Volna.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yours is the fresher of the two, and better able
to use his instinct.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yours is much keener to get to a stable,&#8221; she
laughed.</p>

<p>I walked mine back a little distance and then
gave him his head. He walked deliberately to the
side of the road, and began to crop the grass.</p>

<p>Volna tried hers then; and he went as far as the
fork where he waited for the other to join him.
Then they both moved on to the left.</p>

<p>&#8220;So be it,&#8221; said I, and we let them go as they
would.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not raining so fast,&#8221; declared Volna, presently.
&#8220;Shall we draw up under a tree and give
them the rest of the bread?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll be nice soft food,&#8221; I laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can wring my cloak, too, and ease the weight
from my horse a little.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>We pulled up under a tree and gave the horses
the bread, munching a crust ourselves, and making
the best of things. Volna&#8217;s pluck was inextinguishable;
and she laughed and joked over her plight as
she wrung out the wet.</p>

<p>I struck a match and looked at my watch, and
was startled to find it was nearly ten o&#8217;clock.</p>

<p>I told Volna and we started again. The rain was
much less and the darkness had lifted somewhat;
but I led my horse now instead of riding.</p>

<p>Presently I felt the road getting suspiciously soft
and grassy, and some minutes afterwards I stumbled
up against a gate which blocked the way and led
into a wood.</p>

<p>There was nothing for it but to go back to the
forked road. To make matters worse, the rain
started again and came pouring down even more
violently than before.</p>

<p>Nor was that the worst. We got off the road
again, and once more were brought to a standstill
by a gate.</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks as though we were lost,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve about reached the bottom of our troubles,
I should think,&#8221; replied Volna, still cheery. &#8220;But
if the chance offered, I should like to put off the rest
of the ride till daylight. And look, there&#8217;s a
light.&#8221; She pointed to it gleefully, away to our
left.</p>

<p>We made our way to it with trouble, and found
that it came from the lower window of a small
house.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>I rapped at the door; and the light was instantly
extinguished.</p>

<p>I had to knock again twice, and then a window
above was opened, and a woman put her head out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you, and what do you want? Are
you the police?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Police? No. We have lost our way, and want
shelter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no one in the house but me. How
many are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Two. Myself and my sister. We can pay you
well.&#8221;</p>

<p>She drew her head in for a minute, and then
looked out again and said. &#8220;Are you sure you&#8217;re
only two? Let&#8217;s see you.&#8221; We stood back that
she could do so. &#8220;I&#8217;ll come down,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>When she opened the door the light she held
revealed to me one of the most forbidding faces I
have ever seen on a woman&#8217;s shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got horses, have you? You must stall
them in the shed.&#8221;</p>

<p>She handed me a lantern, and Volna came with
me. When we had fumbled our way to the shed,
and tied the horses up, giving them some hay we
found in the place, we went back to the house.</p>

<p>She admitted us without more delay and as soon
as we were inside, locked and bolted the door. &#8220;A
lone woman needs to be careful,&#8221; she said in explanation,
as she led us into a room at the side
where a fire was burning.</p>

<p>Two glasses and a spirit bottle were on the table,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
and a smell of rank tobacco smoke hung about the
place.</p>

<p>Volna went in first, and the woman, having placed
the light upon the table, stood holding the door for
us to pass.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are much obliged to you,&#8221; I said, and as I
turned to her I caught sight of a man&#8217;s face peering
through the half closed door of a dark room across
the passage.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do my best for you,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;Dry
yourselves by the fire. I&#8217;ll be back in a moment.&#8221;
With that she went out, and I heard her turn the
key softly upon us.</p>

<p>It might mean nothing; but&mdash;well, I did not tell
Volna.</p>

<small>WHAT HAPPENED IN THE COTTAGE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">VOLNA walked up to the wood fire, took off
her fur turban, shook it, and laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Were you ever as wet before? I never was.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder if the woman can find you something
to put on while the clothes are dried. What do
you make of her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She about fits the place,&#8221; she replied, glancing
round the room.</p>

<p>A wooden bench, a couple of wooden armchairs,
a square table and a black oak chest of drawers with
some unpainted shelving over it for crockery, pots,
and pans, constituted the furniture; and for decoration
a couple of crude coloured prints, scriptural in
subject and grimy with age, hung over the fireplace
with a piece of broken looking glass on a string between
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rough,&#8221; I said, in answer to her look.</p>

<p>&#8220;It might be dirtier. It is always a good sign
when a woman&#8217;s care can be traced.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She said she was a lone woman, so she can&#8217;t
have much else to do except look after the place.&#8221;</p>

<p>Volna smiled. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t you see those?&#8221; and
she pointed to a pair of men&#8217;s boots by the chest
of drawers. &#8220;Probably wood cutter or charcoal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
burner or something of that sort; often very honest
people.&#8221;</p>

<p>I thought of the man&#8217;s face I had seen and said
nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you your flask?&#8221; I took it out. &#8220;Good,
then I shall warm some water and you must have a
hot drink;&#8221; and in a minute she had cleaned a small
saucepan and had the water on the fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish the woman would come back,&#8221; I grumbled.
&#8220;I want you to get your wet clothes off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t call her,&#8221; replied Volna.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t let her know that we know she
locked the door.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you notice that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s deliciously man-like, Bob. Of course
we&#8217;re in a very queer place; but we may as well
pretend we see nothing odd and suspect nothing.
We&#8217;re not really blind, however.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I begin to think Peggy&#8217;s more wonderful than
ever,&#8221; said I with a chuckle.</p>

<p>The woman came in then with a bundle of clothes
on her arm; and her manner was very different.
She was a hideous creature truly; the upper part
of her face seamed with what might have been two
knife slashes, and one cheek quite disfigured with
marks like those which vitriol leaves. When she
spoke or smiled her mouth drew up to the side, disclosing
long yellow fangs of teeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, that&#8217;s right; a hot drink you&#8217;re making.
You&#8217;re both wet to the skin, aren&#8217;t you? I&#8217;ve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
rummaged up some clothes for you. I&#8217;ll make
you as comfortable as I can; but I&#8217;m only a poor
woman&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a very kind one,&#8221; said Volna, looking
at the clothes she had brought.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are only rough, you know; but the best
I can manage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Water&#8217;s hot, Bob,&#8221; cried Volna. &#8220;Get me a
cloth to wipe these glasses,&#8221; she said to the woman;
and the moment her back was turned Volna slipped
the papers from her dress and handed them to me.
We mixed some brandy and water and I insisted
upon her drinking some.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve set a candle in the room opposite for you,&#8221;
said the woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Call me when you&#8217;re ready, Peggy;&#8221; and I
went off with the clothes she had brought for me.</p>

<p>I had just completed the change when I heard a
stealthy step in the passage. I was listening for it,
indeed, and had not shut the door. Some one tried
to shut it for me. I stopped that and pulled it wide
open. It was the man whose face I had seen before&mdash;long,
thin, cadaverous and cunning, with close
set, ferrety eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in,&#8221; I said, cheerfully.</p>

<p>He started very uneasily and then mumbled:
&#8220;I thought you didn&#8217;t know it was open.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right. I suppose these are your things.
I&#8217;m much obliged to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re my best,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;You&#8217;re welcome.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>Now he was some four inches shorter than I,
whereas the clothes were quite long enough for me;
and the discrepancy did not escape me, nor tend
to lessen my suspicions.</p>

<p>He stood watching me silently as I finished the
change and took out the contents of my pockets.
But I was careful not to let him see that I had a
weapon.</p>

<p>In the silence I could hear the rain streaming
down.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a fearful night,&#8221; I said; &#8220;your wife said
you weren&#8217;t at home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just come in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You managed to keep dry.&#8221;</p>

<p>He pretended not to hear me. &#8220;It won&#8217;t last
much longer. How did you come here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We got off the road in the dark and saw a light
in your window.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Strangers here, maybe?&#8221; I caught a quick
furtive glance with a gleam of considerable interest
in the shifty eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever been in this particular
spot before; but I shall know better when I see
it by daylight. Anybody can get lost in the
dark.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Going far?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Out for a ride and got caught in the storm.
Will you see to the horses for me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have. Couple of good ones. One of them is
nearly done up. You&#8217;ve come far?&#8221;</p>

<p>At that moment Volna opened the door of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
other room and called me. She burst into a merry
laugh at the sight of me and I grinned back at
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;You look as if you were made up as a peasant
for theatricals,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re like. But I&#8217;m dry.
Think of it, Bob, dry once more.&#8221;</p>

<p>I carried in my wet things and they were soon
steaming by the fire with hers. The woman hustled
about and put some black bread and vile cheese on
the table; while the man stood fidgetting about
sheepishly by the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all I&#8217;ve got to eat; but I can make you some
coffee.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The very thing,&#8221; said Volna.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fetch the coffee, Ivan,&#8221; said the woman. The
man hesitated, glanced at her, and then shuffled
away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, Bob, I&#8217;m famished,&#8221; cried Volna,
sitting down and cutting some bread.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ivan says your horse is done up,&#8221; said the
woman. &#8220;You must be a long way from home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Further than you think,&#8221; replied Volna.
&#8220;We&#8217;re English.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t ride from England?&#8221; she asked
stupidly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You dear soul, there&#8217;s the sea between England
and here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;re strangers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some more bread, Bob?&#8221; and as she bent down
to cut it she whispered in French to me: &#8220;She&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
asked that question a dozen times, trying to pump
me all the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Strangers?&#8221; I said to the woman. &#8220;Of course
we are. Tourists. Don&#8217;t know a soul for many a
mile about here and not a soul knows us. But you
needn&#8217;t be afraid. We can pay you;&#8221; and I took
out a handful of money and tossed a gold piece
across to her.</p>

<p>It was worth the money to see the greedy avaricious
light that leapt in her eyes. But Volna looked
puzzled and a little alarmed at this act of mine.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a time that man is getting the coffee,&#8221;
the woman said. &#8220;I suppose he can&#8217;t find it;&#8221; and
she went out of the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did you do that?&#8221; asked Volna.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not? It was the answer she wanted, and
it&#8217;s quite a relief to be able to tell the truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you suspect anything?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think the man is a long time finding such a
thing as coffee and I wonder they don&#8217;t keep it here
with the rest of their eatables;&#8221; and Volna shewed
that she understood me.</p>

<p>The two came back wrangling: she scolding him
for his delay; he protesting he didn&#8217;t know where
she kept things. They were clumsy actors, however.</p>

<p>The woman made some coffee then and set it on
the table. &#8220;I&#8217;m thinking where I&#8217;ll put you to
sleep,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You can have our bed and
welcome,&#8221; she added to Volna; &#8220;but for your
brother, I&#8217;ll have to make one up somehow. You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
see we&#8217;re only poor folks. But we&#8217;ll manage.
Come, Ivan.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was stirring my coffee and put it to my lips as
they went out; and the woman turned and saw me.
This time instead of locking the door upon us, they
left it ajar.</p>

<p>It was becoming as plain as print.</p>

<p>I set down the cup, untasted, of course, and
talked in a fairly loud tone about the kindness of
the two and how good the coffee tasted; and Volna
taking her cue from me agreed.</p>

<p>Then we all but emptied the two cups into a jug
and hid it away, and went on talking unconcernedly.
Presently I stole to the door and listened. The
two were in the upper part of the house.</p>

<p>Volna, I could see now, was beginning to grow
nervous.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right. We can act much better than
they, and there isn&#8217;t a thing to fear.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her brow wrinkled. &#8220;I think Peggy doesn&#8217;t
want to be left alone, Bob,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to make shift with that wooden
settle; but you may go to sleep without a thought.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think they mean to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve half done what they meant and we
shall soon know the rest. The coffee is drugged of
course, and they think we&#8217;ve drunk it. Now, lie
down and just go off to sleep. I&#8217;ve dried my last
three cigars and am going to smoke one of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>I settled her on the wooden bench and having
lighted my cigar, rummaged about and found an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
oily rag with which I cleaned my revolver very
carefully, reloaded it and kept it at hand.</p>

<p>I then sat down by the fire smoking and thinking
and waiting. It was evident enough that we had
got into the hands of some very ugly customers.
I recalled several strange tales of dark deeds done
in these wild and lonely parts of the country; and
the circumstances now lent themselves readily to
villainy.</p>

<p>They had got from us the fact that we were
strangers, and I had purposely made no hesitation
in shewing that we had plenty of money. That
they had tried in their clumsy way to drug us, I
had no doubt whatever; and the only question was
what they meant to do next.</p>

<p>The fear in the woman&#8217;s first question whether
we were the police, and her statement that the man
was not in the house, gave a clue to their character;
and the change in manner, the assumption of friendliness,
the suggestiveness of sending the man to
find the coffee; indeed all these circumstances fitted
together too well to leave any doubt that some devilment
was on foot.</p>

<p>I did not feel the least alarmed, however. I felt
myself more than a match for the two in any rough
and tumble that was to come; I was thoroughly on
my guard; and had a weapon and knew well
enough how to use it. As a matter of fact it was
we rather than they who were laying the snare.</p>

<p>Somewhere between half an hour and an hour
passed without a sound in the house. I had finished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
my cigar and tossed it away and was gazing into
the flickering embers of the fire, when I heard the
stairs creak slightly. A glance shewed me that
Volna was asleep; a tribute this, indeed, to her
trust in me.</p>

<p>I dropped my head as though I, too, were asleep
and breathed heavily. I was very curious to know
what was to happen.</p>

<p>In a short while the door was pushed open noiselessly
and the woman put her head in. I had
already set her down for the head of the firm, as
the more courageous of the pair of rascals.</p>

<p>She looked at us both for some moments and then
entered and crept towards Volna. Not daring to
let her go too near, I shifted my position and
grunted, as if uneasy in my sleep. This drew her
attention to me, as I intended, and she stopped and
stared at me.</p>

<p>Next she moved to the table and took up the two
cups one after another; glanced from them to us
in turn; and concluding that we had drunk the contents,
set them down with a slight grunt of satisfaction.</p>

<p>The logs slipped in the fire at that moment with
a shower of sparks. She started and took a quick
step towards the door.</p>

<p>Thinking she was going I moved, breathed very
heavily and blinked at her as though almost overcome
with sleep.</p>

<p>&#8220;I came for the light,&#8221; she said in a low voice.
&#8220;Our candle&#8217;s out.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>For answer I nodded, waved my hand clumsily
to signify she could take it, attempted to rise and
fell back in my chair, huddled together as if completely
overcome with stupor.</p>

<p>She stood with the lamp in her hand as if planning
what to do next; a look of diabolical evil on her
hideous face. Then slowly and cautiously she came
towards me. Having satisfied myself that she had
no knife or weapon I shut my eyes and let her hold
the light close to my face. I could feel her breath
as she bent forward to listen to my breathing.</p>

<p>After a moment she moved away and crossed to
Volna, whom she examined with the same scrutiny.
A low sigh of satisfaction escaped her, as she turned
away and went out of the room, carrying the lamp
with her. I heard the stairs creak as she crept up
them.</p>

<p>Then I woke Volna. &#8220;Don&#8217;t be frightened. Pretend
to be asleep. Something is going to happen;
the woman has been in to make sure that we are
asleep; and will no doubt be back in a moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>I went back to my chair and waited, ready to
resume my extremely uncomfortable position at a
moment&#8217;s notice.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards the stairs creaked again, more
noisily this time; probably under the heavier
weight of them both; but instead of entering the
room the steps went along the passage. Then I
heard sounds in the distance; just muffled confused
noises of knocking and stamping. What
caused them I could not conjecture.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>Soon after they had ceased, the footsteps came
again into the passage, and a moving streak of light
shewed through the door of our room. This time
something weighty was set down with a heavy bump
just outside the door; a most unaccountable rustling
followed; and then the two whispered together.
In the pause a pungent odour of paraffin came from
the lamp they had.</p>

<p>All sorts of weird conjectures crowded into my
thoughts as to the possible meaning of this development.
Volna had heard it all and looked at me in
bewilderment. I motioned her to keep silence.</p>

<p>Another journey was made up the creaky staircase.
It was the man who went, and while he was
away the woman looked in upon us. I saw to my
surprise this time that she wore her bonnet.</p>

<p>As the man&#8217;s tread was on the stairs again she
drew back and in a whisper loud enough to reach
us, she said: &#8220;It&#8217;s all right, you coward. They&#8217;re
both off fast enough. You can do it safely now.
The man first, mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next moment the door was pushed wide open
and they both entered stealthily.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br />


<small>A VERY TIGHT CORNER</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE suspense of the two or three moments
which followed the entrance of the pair constituted
an ordeal not to be forgotten. That Volna
mastered herself sufficiently to pass through it
without a sign or sound, was the greatest proof of
her courage she could have given.</p>

<p>It was less trying for me. I had witnessed the
woman&#8217;s former visit, and, despite her ominous
whisper to her husband, had come to the conclusion
that no attempt was to be made on our lives. Moreover
I was armed. But Volna knew nothing of this.
I had only been able to whisper a hurried and very
indefinite warning to her, calculated, despite my
assurance, to work up her fears to a high strain.</p>

<p>They stood still for some moments; the man
slightly in front of his wife, who set a candle she
was carrying down behind her. The faces of both
then caught the red gleam from the embers of the
fire; and so evil looking a couple I hope never to
see again.</p>

<p>The man&#8217;s long, thin, cunning face was strained
and intense, and his narrow treacherous eyes glanced
from me to Volna and back from Volna to me, as
if in doubt which to attack first. Just behind him
stood the tall, gaunt, and angular form of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
woman inciting him; her eyes gleaming with excitement,
her lips parted and drawn in a snarl to one
side, and every line, cicatrice and seam of her scarred
repulsive features brought into strong relief by the
ruddy gleam of the log fire. She looked a veritable
hag of evil, utterly detestable, deadly, and loathsome.</p>

<p>&#8220;The man first,&#8221; she whispered, jogging her
accomplice.</p>

<p>He glanced half round to her, irritable, and then
I saw that he was carrying a length of cord.</p>

<p>He began to creep slowly toward me until
Volna, as she confessed afterwards, could endure it
no longer. She sprang up and called me.</p>

<p>In another moment I was on my feet; and before
the two could recover from their astonishment, I
sprang past them, slammed the door, and set my
back against it, my hand on my revolver.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now perhaps you&#8217;ll tell me what this means?&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman was for fighting and stood at bay like
a beast, just robbed of its intended victim. But the
man was of poorer stuff, and cowered ashen white
and speechless.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mayn&#8217;t we move about our own house?&#8221; asked
the woman. &#8220;Ivan, if you&#8217;re a man, you won&#8217;t
stand this.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Ivan had no sort of fight in him. He clapped
his hands to his face and sank into my chair by the
fire. The hag looked his way and swore at him
with a snarl of contempt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come now, what does this mean?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>&#8220;It means that if you don&#8217;t like it, you can clear
out, the pair of you;&#8221; and she turned fiercely on
Volna. &#8220;Coming here with your lies about being
lost, and wanting to rob poor and honest folk, and
then trumping up a lying accusation. Who are you,
I&#8217;d like to know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her assurance was as brazen as her courage was
unquestionable; I own I was at a loss what to do.</p>

<p>&#8220;That won&#8217;t do with me. Your one chance is
to tell the truth,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a man, aren&#8217;t you, to call a woman a
liar? Do you hear that, Ivan?&#8221; and she went to
him and shook him. &#8220;Get up, pig: don&#8217;t sit
shaking there when you hear me abused by this
thief of the night.&#8221; She hauled him to his feet;
and Volna took the opportunity of crossing to my
side.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t talk like that here,&#8221; he said with a
sort of hang-dog manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather talk to you than to the woman there.
Now you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You hear that, Ivan. Strike him for that.
You deal with him and I&#8217;ll look after the wench.&#8221;
She pushed him toward me and seemed for the
moment to infect him with some of her own desperate
courage.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t like it, go,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, they shan&#8217;t go now,&#8221; interrupted the fury.
&#8220;We daren&#8217;t let them go now, you fool. You
know. Go on.&#8221;</p>

<p>He still hung back, however, and then she suddenly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
wrenched open a drawer and took out a
formidable looking chopper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, Ivan, now will you do it? Down with
the man and leave the wench to me. It will be
death if we don&#8217;t do it and get away.&#8221;</p>

<p>The remnants of his courage awoke when he felt
the weapon in his hand; and I heard Volna catch
her breath at the look which gradually stole into
his beady, cruel eyes, as he looked at me.</p>

<p>Goaded by the woman&#8217;s taunts and the fear-thoughts
which her words had started, he took a
couple of stealthy steps toward me while the woman
went round the table to reach Volna.</p>

<p>Just as he was raising his weapon to rush at me,
I whipped my revolver out and covered him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Drop that; you murderous devil,&#8221; I cried, in a
ringing tone.</p>

<p>With a cry of fear he started back and let the
chopper fall on the brick floor. In a moment I had
possession of it, and handed my pistol to Volna.</p>

<p>&#8220;If she moves, use it,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>But the sudden turning of the tables had knocked
the fight even out of the virago of a woman. The
man no longer counted. He stumbled back and
cowered against the wall, getting as far away from
me as possible, and just stared at me beside himself
with fright.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now we can talk,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t mean anything,&#8221; declared the
woman. &#8220;We were only trying to frighten you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
so that we might get safely out of the room. I&#8217;m
sure I tried to do all I could for you; giving you
food and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll do. Go to that end of the room.&#8221; She
obeyed me. &#8220;Now answer my questions. Why
did you come stealing into the room just now&mdash;before
this time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I only wanted to see you were all right and to
fetch the lamp. I&#8217;ve done my best for you,&#8221; she
murmured in a whining, canting, fawning tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t answer, eh? Well, I&#8217;ll give your
man a chance. Now you, tell me what was that
rope for that you brought in?&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman tried to reply, but I silenced her.
The man glared at me speechless and helpless.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your only chance is to tell the truth. You
were going to tie me up with it? Confess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, no,&#8221; he gasped through his pallid lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;You had two ropes; one for me and one for
my sister here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, no,&#8221; he repeated.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know I speak the truth. But if you won&#8217;t
confess that, tell me why you drugged that coffee
you gave me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman broke out again declaring by all the
saints that I must be mad to ask such a question.
The man only gazed stupidly at me in silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let him drink it then,&#8221; said Volna; and the
woman&#8217;s start at the shrewd suggestion told me
that it had struck home.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s the test,&#8221; I agreed readily. &#8220;Will
you get that jug?&#8221;</p>

<p>Volna took out the jug and poured the coffee
back into the cups.</p>

<p>They both watched her intently as she did this,
turning now and then from her to me, with swift
glances of speculative fear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now if this is not drugged or poisoned, drink
it;&#8221; and I took one of the cups and held it toward
the man; &#8220;Quick,&#8221; I cried, so sternly that he
trembled. His eyes were everywhere except on my
face, and his lips moved convulsively.</p>

<p>&#8220;Drink it, fool,&#8221; said the woman with a sneer.</p>

<p>He stretched out his hand toward the cup, and
then with a swift gesture struck at it and dashed
it to the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew it. I need no more proof,&#8221; I declared.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll drink it,&#8221; cried the woman, making a snatch
at the cup on the table. But I caught her hand, and
Volna took away the cup.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, that is for the police,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>At the mention of the police an angry oath
leapt from her lips and she strove desperately to
wrench her hand from my grip to get the cup. I
had to use some violence to thrust her back.</p>

<p>Foiled in the effort to destroy the traces of the
drug, her rage completely mastered her; and being
unable to vent it upon us, she turned upon the man.
With a running accompaniment of abuse and reproaches
as the cause of the trouble she seized him
and shook him till his teeth rattled like castanets,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
and then clouted and kicked him and tore at him
with her nails like a fiend incarnate until he fell
huddled up on the floor howling to her to stop.</p>

<p>Volna opened the door and went out to escape the
din and repulsive sight and then called me hurriedly.</p>

<p>In a moment the whole infernal scheme of the
two was made clear. The heavy burden which we
had heard set down outside the door and which had
so puzzled me was explained, as well as the mysterious
rustling which had set me wondering.</p>

<p>The one was a cask half full of petroleum; the
other a huge heap of shavings, chips and hay, ready
saturated with petroleum.</p>

<p>&#8220;They meant to bind us in our sleep and fire the
house. I did not think there could be such fiends,&#8221;
said Volna, trembling.</p>

<p>It was too obvious to question. The heap of
shavings laid ready for lighting told its own story;
and with the petroleum thrown into the room where
we were to have been left bound and unconscious,
nothing could have saved us.</p>

<p>Volna clung to my arm faint and cold with the
horror of it. &#8220;Let us go,&#8221; she whispered.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is why the woman was dressed to go
out. I see it now. That fear of hers of the police,
the noise we heard outside; they were expecting
the police and meant to fly on our horses. Such
devils ought not to be allowed to escape.&#8221;</p>

<p>But it was obvious that we dared not run the risk
of denouncing them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>&#8220;Let us go,&#8221; said Volna again. &#8220;The very air
of the place makes me faint and ill.&#8221;</p>

<p>I went back into the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have found out all your infernal scheme.
Get out of here, and keep out of sight, lest I take
the law in my own hands;&#8221; and I drew the revolver
again to emphasize my words.</p>

<p>The man was seemingly afraid to move; so I
dragged him to his feet, hauled him to the door
and flung him down in the passage. &#8220;Upstairs
with you and if I catch so much as a glimpse of
you I&#8217;ll shoot you like the murderous skunk you
are.&#8221;</p>

<p>He crawled away from my feet and slunk up the
creaking staircase shaking in every limb and casting
frightened glances behind him.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to do?&#8221; asked the woman,
coming to the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold your tongue,&#8221; I thundered. &#8220;Go to
the villain you egged on to do this thing. Quick,
or&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She was scared by my rage and went
without another word.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I change?&#8221; asked Volna.</p>

<p>I nodded. &#8220;And bring me my things. I&#8217;ll stop
on guard here.&#8221;</p>

<p>I heard the two muttering and wrangling in the
room above; but neither made any attempt to
come down; and in some few minutes we were
ready.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll go together and get the horses,&#8221; I said
to Volna; and was in the act of opening the door<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
when I started involuntarily as some one beat a
loud peremptory summons on the panel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Open the door there, open,&#8221; called a voice.</p>

<p>Volna started and clutched my arm. &#8220;What
shall we do?&#8221;</p>

<p>If it was the police, we were caught like rats in
a trap.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must brazen it out,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;The papers?&#8221; she whispered. The knocking
was repeated more loudly and insistently than before.
&#8220;Open there, at once. I say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;See if there&#8217;s fire enough to burn them.&#8221;</p>

<p>She ran back into the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is there?&#8221; I called.</p>

<p>&#8220;The police. Open or we shall break in.&#8221;</p>

<p>To shew hesitation would be fatal. So I unfastened
the door and threw it open.</p>

<p>At that moment, Volna came back and shook her
head.</p>

<p>Two men entered. &#8220;You are our prisoners,&#8221;
cried the first comer. &#8220;If you resist the consequences
will be on your heads.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t resist. I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;ve come.&#8221;</p>

<p>They seized and held us both; the man who took
me snatching the revolver which was still in my
hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, a police weapon,&#8221; he said, significantly,
and shewed it to his companion, who appeared to be
in command.</p>

<p>&#8220;Search them both for any more weapons,&#8221; came
the order, sharp and ringing.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>&#8220;Wait a moment. There is a mistake here,&#8221;
I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve made it then, in letting us net you here
so easily;&#8221; and they both laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the charge against us?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>It was about as tight a corner as fate in an ill-natured
mood could have devised for us.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br />


<small>THE HAG TO THE RESCUE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">I &nbsp;KNEW enough of the methods of the police not
to lay too much emphasis at the outset upon
the fact that they had blundered. The police are
pretty much the same all the world over. Charge
them with blundering, and they will exhaust every
resource to disprove the charge; and in the meantime,
you who have made it are getting badly
squeezed.</p>

<p>Moreover, I was not certain that it was a blunder.
I hoped they were after the villainous couple who
lived in the house, and that in the haste and confusion
of the moment we had been mistaken for
them. But it was quite possible Volna and I had
been tracked, and were really the prisoners they
sought.</p>

<p>In any case it was highly dangerous for us to be
in their hands, and we should need to keep cool
heads to get out again, without the fact becoming
known that we were fugitives.</p>

<p>As it was, only an accident prevented the incriminating
papers from being immediately found.
Just the luck that I had told Volna to try and burn
them and had not taken them back from her. The
search to which she was subjected was little more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
than formal; but my pockets were all overhauled,
and my papers taken out and examined.</p>

<p>I was not so foolish as to resist; but I began to
feel pretty indignant when papers, money, and all,
were retained by the leader.</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you get this?&#8221; he asked, holding up
the police revolver. He appeared to attach great
importance to my possession of it. This interested
me greatly. That I had taken it from the police
agent on the Devil&#8217;s Staircase would certainly be
known; and if he was in search of us, it was a
sufficient proof that we were the persons wanted. I
had to get at that indirectly.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you will permit me I will give you an exact
report of what has happened here, and that will
account for everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All I want is a plain answer to my question.
No long round-about, lying story.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no help for it. I must lie. So I did it
boldly. &#8220;Most fortunately I got the revolver
here,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a cool hand,&#8221; was the sneering reply.
&#8220;But it won&#8217;t do you any good to lie to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fortunately, I mean, because it saved my life
and that of my sister here. We were attacked&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean there are any others in the
house?&#8221; he broke in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly I do. The two wretches who appear
to have been living here are in a room above.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both the man and his wife had kept as quiet as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
mutes all this time. But they had evidently been
listening, for at that moment the door above was
opened, and the two came out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that the police? Is that the police?&#8221; cried
the woman. &#8220;Heaven, and the blessed Virgin
above be praised. We&#8217;ve been nearly murdered by
the two villains there. You&#8217;ll protect us now,
won&#8217;t you? Praise to the Holy Saints for having
sent you to our assistance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s all this?&#8221;</p>

<p>The couple came running down the stairs and
threw themselves on their knees; the woman pouring
out a voluble account of how they had been attacked
by us and their lives threatened, mingled with
thanks for their deliverance, entreaties to protect
them, and an urgent warning to pay special attention
to me as a dangerous and murderous villain.</p>

<p>I foresaw a very awkward complication. When
two parties accuse each other, the police rule is to
arrest both.</p>

<p>The leader was obviously perplexed. &#8220;What is
your name?&#8221; he said to me; and before I could
reply the woman burst in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ivan Krempel, and that&#8217;s Nita, his wife,&#8221; she
cried. &#8220;They&#8217;ve been using the house for days and
days past.&#8221;</p>

<p>I attempted to deny this; but he silenced me.
&#8220;And your names,&#8221; he asked the woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is my husband, Peter Vranowski, the
woodcutter; I am Anna his wife. We came last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
week from Potzden in Silesia, and have been lodging
here with these Krempels. We thought they
were honest folks like ourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are the man I am searching for,&#8221; he said,
turning to me. &#8220;Ivan Krempel, and his wife,
Nita.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was good news in a way. He was not after
the Garretts, and I could safely use that name.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can understand your perplexity,&#8221; I said
calmly. &#8220;But this woman is lying. We are English;
Robert Garrett and Margaret Garrett, brother
and sister. Caught by the storm to-night, we came
here for shelter, and narrowly escaped death at the
hands of these two.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But these people say you are the Krempels.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So they are. So they are. The holy Virgin
knows I speak the truth,&#8221; protested the old hag.</p>

<p>&#8220;The proof is in your hands. Our passports are
among the papers which you have taken from me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go into the room there, all of you,&#8221; he
answered, after a pause. I led the way with Volna
and the rest followed. &#8220;Get a light,&#8221; he said to
Volna, the candle having been extinguished in the
former scrimmage.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know where to look for one. There
was a lamp here, but the woman took it away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen to her. Listen to her. Oh, the liar,
when she carried it upstairs with her own hands,&#8221;
cried the hag.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go upstairs and see if it&#8217;s there,&#8221; he told his
man, who went and returned carrying it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>&#8220;The woman was right in that,&#8221; said the officer
significantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;She would very naturally know where she herself
took it,&#8221; I exclaimed; but he was as pig-headed
as his class, and repeated his statements, adding
to my concern, &#8220;I don&#8217;t see how I can decide this.
It&#8217;s beyond me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are my papers,&#8221; I reminded him. &#8220;But
surely you have only to look at that man and his
wife, and contrast them with my sister and myself
to see the difference. You must have some description
of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>He mumbled to himself and began to finger my
papers. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see anything here to guide
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Those are the passports;&#8221; and I pointed to
them.</p>

<p>He unfolded them. &#8220;I don&#8217;t read English,&#8221; he
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can read the names at any rate and, of
course, as a responsible official so near the frontier
you know a passport by sight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He stole that from an Englishman. He boasted
of it to us,&#8221; interjected the woman, who had been
watching closely.</p>

<p>&#8220;How am I to know this is yours?&#8221; he asked
immediately, taking the cue suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are twenty proofs in those papers, that I
am an Englishman; as well as on myself. See, the
pocket book there has the address of a London
maker. Here, the tab on my coat has my tailor&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
name in London. Don&#8217;t you hear that I speak with
a foreign accent?&#8221;</p>

<p>He examined the pocket book, and the tab on my
coat; and appeared to be impressed. &#8220;They seem
right; but you may have stolen them,&#8221; he said
grudgingly.</p>

<p>I pressed the advantage. Picking out a couple of
Sylvia&#8217;s letters I shewed him they were in English,
and addressed to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is not Robert&mdash;that is B-o-b,&#8221; he said
suspiciously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Robert in England is shortened into Bob,&#8221; I
explained; but he shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here is one on the same paper, Wyrley Court,
Great Malverton. It is from my mother, &#8216;My dear
son Robert.&#8217; You can read that?&#8221; and I stuck at
him until I had deepened the impression. Then I
told him briefly what had happened in the cottage,
pointed to the heap of soaked shavings, the two
ropes and a cask of petroleum.</p>

<p>This was not done without many interruptions
from the woman, who vociferously denied the whole
story.</p>

<p>&#8220;You say you were to be drugged? How do
you know?&#8221; I told him of the attempt to make
the man drink a cup of the coffee. This appealed to
him; and he smiled grimly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you still the cup you saved?&#8221;</p>

<p>Volna got it and handed it to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;The woman shall drink it now,&#8221; he declared.
But the old hag swore that it was we who had made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
the coffee, not she; and that we had tried to rob
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should we wish to rob a woodcutter,&#8221; I
asked. I had his ear now and he began to have a
glimmer of reason. &#8220;Besides, our horses are outside
in the shed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are our horses,&#8221; asserted the woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go and look at them. See if a woodcutter, just
a week here from Silesia, as she says, would possess
two such animals and saddles. One is a side
saddle, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>He sent his man out; and sat silent. Matters
were going better, so I left him to absorb the points
I had made.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you drink that coffee?&#8221; he asked the
woman suddenly, very sternly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should I drink the poison we refused
before?&#8221; she cried, and pointing her scraggy
finger at Volna added: &#8220;She made it, let her
drink it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; I said; and he nodded in agreement.</p>

<p>Then his man came back and reported that the
horses were two good ones and that the saddles were
soaked as if they had been exposed to the fury of
the storm; thus bearing out my story.</p>

<p>But at that point I made a serious blunder. As
he turned to listen to his man&#8217;s report I picked up
the passports. He saw me, and snatched at the rest
of the papers.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t touch those,&#8221; he said angrily.
&#8220;Return me those two you have taken.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>Instead, I put them back in my pocket. &#8220;They
are our passports,&#8221; I answered; &#8220;I am an Englishman,
and have a right to retain them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give them to me,&#8221; he repeated.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are necessary to me, and I must keep
them. I am doing no more than is my right.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then his man bent, and whispered in his ear.
&#8220;I had forgotten,&#8221; he said. &#8220;My man here reads
English well. Let him see them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They have already been examined, and I must
keep them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall see,&#8221; he exclaimed very angrily. With
that he gave the rest of the papers to the man who
went through them carefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am inclined to believe your story, but your
conduct is in some ways very suspicious. Will you
return me those papers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I have shown them. That is enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the man drew his attention to a paper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! What do you say your name is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Robert Garrett, an Englishman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then who is Robert Anstruther?&#8221;</p>

<p>In a moment my heart fell. I knew what was
coming.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here is a letter of credit for a large sum of
money, the name on it is Robert Anstruther. Explain
your possession of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>I tried to affect indifference. &#8220;Oh, that!&#8221; I exclaimed.
&#8220;Robert Anstruther is my cousin, and
I am taking it to him to Cracow.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>But he didn&#8217;t believe me.</p>

<p>&#8220;You say you are English, and this lady your
sister?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have seen our passports proving that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you can speak to her,&#8221; he said to his man.
I saw the scheme of course, instantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are Miss Garrett?&#8221; the man asked in excellent
English.</p>

<p>Lies, like curses, have a nasty habit of coming
home to roost; and for the moment I was at the end
of my wits. The game was nearly up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Volna, very nervously.</p>

<p>&#8220;My superior doubts that you are English; just
tell me anything you please that I may hear you
speak English!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t bother with him, Peggy,&#8221; I declared in
English, putting up a last bluff of indignation.
&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to have my sister bullied. Put your
questions to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a very simple test.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hang your simple tests. We&#8217;ve had more than
enough of your tomfoolery.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You refuse to speak?&#8221; he asked her again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. At all events I refuse to allow you or
any one else to browbeat her. We have nearly lost
our lives here; and now, when she is all to pieces,
you not only take us for a couple of murderous
ruffians and want to arrest us, but you try this sort
of infernal nonsense.&#8221;</p>

<p>I left him in no doubt that I was English, and
voluble enough, too. He shrugged his shoulders,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
and told his chief the result of the test; and they
whispered together.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are Robert Garrett of Wyrley Hall, Great
Malverton?&#8221; he asked me then in English.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve told you who I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then how is it that Robert Anstruther in the
letter of credit, is described as of that address?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t one relative live with another?&#8221; I
laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Permit me to see the address on the passport.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is none. You ought to know that;&#8221; and
with a scoff I unfolded it and shewed him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mean there. I mean on the outside,
where the name and address are both written.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going to be baited no longer,&#8221; I rattled
back sharply, and was putting the papers away
again when he snatched them from me. A glance
was enough to prove the inconsistency of my statement;
and he reported this to his chief, who put my
papers away and rose.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall take you all four to the police office at
Schirmskad,&#8221; he decided.</p>

<p>I had not the least intention of letting him do
anything of the kind; but my unwillingness was as
smoke to fire compared with that of the woman and
her husband. She broke out into a violent tirade
swearing she was innocent and would not go.</p>

<p>&#8220;Resist at your peril,&#8221; cried the chief in a loud
ringing tone; and he and his man drew their
revolvers.</p>

<p>There was a moment of dead silence. My eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
were on the chief, and I saw a shadow of perplexity
cloud his face. I read it to mean that he had
his doubts how to get us all four away if we
resisted.</p>

<p>It was a queer turn of the wheel that Volna and
I should have to make common cause with the
wretches who had attempted our lives. I did not
wish them to escape; but our own escape was much
more to us than their capture at that moment; and
like the chief I was thinking intently what to do.</p>

<p>Glancing round the room his eye fell on the two
ropes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hand me those cords,&#8221; he said to me, curtly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am no police agent,&#8221; I shot back.</p>

<p>&#8220;I call on you to help me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You forget; you have arrested me. You must
do your own work.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old hag&#8217;s eyes were on us as she drank in
every word; and she nudged her husband and
whispered to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you mean to charge them with attempting
your lives?&#8221; asked the chief.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have arrested me,&#8221; I returned, shortly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tie those two together,&#8221; he said, turning to his
assistant.</p>

<p>To get the cords the man had either to pass the
woman or drive her before him to the end of the
room. He tried the latter course and pushed her
violently. She fell to the ground, and, letting out a
yell shrill enough to wake a cataleptic, clasped his
legs, and pulled him down; and in a moment, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
noisy rough and tumble scuffle was set going between
the three.</p>

<p>The chief ran to help his man, and I took advantage
of the moment to open the door and put Volna
outside.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop there,&#8221; cried the chief, holding me up with
his levelled revolver.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am merely putting my sister out of the way
of trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Move an inch and I shall fire,&#8221; he shouted.</p>

<p>But the words scarcely passed his lips before he
came staggering wildly toward me; his arms went
up and his pistol was fired in the air. The woman
had in some way extricated herself from the struggle
on the floor, and his back being turned to her as she
rose, she pushed him violently toward me. I caught
him and helped myself to his revolver.</p>

<p>We were struggling together when the woman,
who had seized hold of the lamp, passed us and
dashed it violently into the heap of saturated hay
and shavings.</p>

<p>The effect was instantaneous. A blinding flare
of flame burst out, almost like an explosion, and a
volume of pungent suffocating smoke filled the
place.</p>

<p>Volna, quick-witted as ever, wrenched the door
open, and I staggered out after her into the night,
dragging the chief with me.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br />


<small>FATHER AMBROSE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE pendulum of luck had swung over again to
our side and I lost no time in taking advantage
of it. I pushed the man away from me at random,
and chanced to send him staggering up against the
two police horses which were tied up close to the
door. They were already snorting with fear at the
fire, and they now began to plunge and kick and
rear until they had dragged themselves free and
dashed off into the darkness.</p>

<p>Nor was this all the luck.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; I cried to Volna. We ran to the shed
and found our own animals standing ready saddled
outside. &#8220;They were going to bolt on our horses,&#8221;
I said, as I put her in the saddle and then mounted.
&#8220;Which is the way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Any way. We&#8217;re in luck; let us trust to it,&#8221;
I answered; and guided by the light of the fire
which was now consuming the whole house, we
pushed along at random as quickly as we could.
Fortune was with us still. We gained the road, and
in a few minutes were rattling back at a brisk pace
along the road we had travelled so laboriously in
the storm some hours before.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had given everything up,&#8221; said Volna, when
we were breathing the horses and were able to talk.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
&#8220;I had the papers in my hand ready to throw them
into the blaze.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad you didn&#8217;t. We&#8217;ll get them through
yet; but just how to do it is the question. We&#8217;ve
escaped by sheer luck and that old hag&#8217;s devilment
in firing the house; but they&#8217;ve got the passports,
all my papers and what&#8217;s almost as bad, nearly all
my money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a little money. But do you think we
could get across the frontier?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall have to do it at night, because we must
manage to sneak over somewhere unseen. If we
knew the district it would be easier; but even then
we should have to lie low somewhere all through
the day. We may bet on it that when that fellow
gets back from the fire he&#8217;ll spread out a pretty wide
search party for us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does Sylvia ever offer you suggestions?&#8221; she
asked.</p>

<p>I smiled. &#8220;Has Peggy one?&#8221;</p>

<p>She nodded. &#8220;She&#8217;s a little bit afraid to offer
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s rather rough on Bob, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Paul always ridicules anything I say&mdash;never
thinks any woman, but Katinka, can have a sensible
idea.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why shouldn&#8217;t Bob think as much of Peggy&#8217;s
notions as Paul does of Katinka&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I like that,&#8221; she said, answering my smile.
&#8220;But it&#8217;s rather a wild suggestion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s have it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t we go back to that village, Kervatje,
and get Father Ambrose to help us? He was
mother&#8217;s friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph! It <i>is</i> rather a wild one, as you
say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe we could trust him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And suppose he said no?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We could have shelter for the day at least and
could try any other plan that offered.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He might give us away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His eyes didn&#8217;t look like that when he spoke of
mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d have to confess we fooled him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Leave me to do that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your instinct is to trust him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I feel as sure of him as I did of&mdash;of Bob
that morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That settles it. I can&#8217;t mistrust that instinct.
Come on;&#8221; and off we rattled again at a pace we
relished a deal better than the scarcely rested horse
under me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder what has happened at the cottage,&#8221;
said Volna when we eased up later.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a sort of sneaking hope that the woman
got away despite her villainous attempt on us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a fiend of a woman!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Her fiendishness it was that saved us from
heaven knows what trouble. I was cudgelling my
wits to know how to get out of the mess. She was
a cunning devil, too, in her way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the man, too. A man!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>&#8220;She was the man in that house. Say what
you will, it was awfully smart to spring that accusation
against us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope she&#8217;ll be punished,&#8221; said Volna.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, she&#8217;ll get there some day&mdash;if not now. But
you are the wonder to me. To go through all you
have in the last few hours and yet be as fresh as&mdash;as
paint. Sylvia has pluck and all that; but she&#8217;d
go to bed after a rough and tumble of this sort.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the first thing I shall ask the priest to
let me do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll be a bit surprised when we walk in, I
expect,&#8221; I laughed. &#8220;It&#8217;s a pretty cool thing you&#8217;re
letting us into.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think there&#8217;s any chance of our being
followed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet. I fancy they&#8217;ll have their hands full
enough with the other couple. We shall be miles
on our way before they could start after us; and
it&#8217;s too early for any one to be about to tell them
which way we&#8217;ve gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>This proved to be the case. We did not meet a
soul until we had ridden many miles and were nearing
the forked road at the top of the hill which the
priest had mentioned to me. There we passed two
or three peasants dressed in their best.</p>

<p>&#8220;That explains it,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;What explains what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why we have seen no one about. It&#8217;s Sunday
morning and those people are going in to mass.
Your friend the priest is evidently popular.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>&#8220;Can we reach the village before mass time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. We had better finish the journey on foot.
My idea is to turn off somewhere at the bottom
of the hill and just leave the horses. We can&#8217;t very
well quarter them on the priest as well as ourselves.
Besides, it would cause much more gossip than
if we were to arrive on foot. And gossip is
dangerous.&#8221;</p>

<p>On reaching the bottom of the hill, we turned off
and rode a mile or so, when I saw a shed in a very
lonely spot on a hill side. I slipped the saddles off
and led the horses through a couple of fields and
shut them into the barn.</p>

<p>&#8220;No one is likely to be there till to-morrow, so
we may get them again this afternoon if necessary,&#8221;
I said as I returned to Volna with the bridles.
&#8220;There&#8217;s a bit of feed on the place and that&#8217;ll keep
them quiet. Now we&#8217;ll hide these things in the
wood yonder; and leave the rest to chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>I buried the saddles under a heap of brushwood,
and we made our way back to the main road and
soon reached the village.</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel disgracefully dirty,&#8221; said Volna, as one
or two of the villagers eyed us curiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll only think we&#8217;ve come some distance
to mass; and they are accustomed to the sight of
dirty people about here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Volna laughed. &#8220;Thank you. But even here
the people wash themselves on Sunday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s the priest&#8217;s house, next the church,&#8221; I
answered irrelevantly. We walked up to it and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
just as we reached the door it was opened by a
woman, bonnetted and prayer book in hand.</p>

<p>I stepped inside without shewing any hesitation;
as if we were expected. &#8220;Good-morning. Is Father
Ambrose in his study or already at church?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Father is in church, sir. You can&#8217;t come
in, please,&#8221; she replied, resenting our intrusion.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was afraid we should be just too late and too
early,&#8221; I said lightly to Volna. &#8220;He said before
ten or after half-past twelve. But we couldn&#8217;t
manage it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is the Father expecting you, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, not exactly at this moment evidently, or
he would have told you to be ready for us. But
we can wait, and my sister will be greatly obliged
to you if you can let her just wash her face and
hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am on my way to mass, sir; the Father said
nothing to me of your coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So I see, my good soul. But did he not tell
you we were likely to come for breakfast?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Father fasts until mass on Sunday, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, of course, but I am not a priest: nor is
my sister.&#8221;</p>

<p>She hesitated and then led us into the study.</p>

<p>Volna threw herself with a sigh of fatigue on to
one of the hard wooden chairs; took off her hat
and with a smile exclaimed in the most natural way
in the world: &#8220;Dear Father Ambrose. He is one
of my mother&#8217;s dearest friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was such apparently ingenuous evidence of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
sincerity that the good woman was instantly and
most favourably impressed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Excuse me a minute,&#8221; she said, and went out.</p>

<p>&#8220;How readily you tell them, Bob,&#8221; said Volna,
smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was your acting that carried us through,
young lady. Dear Father Ambrose, indeed. As if
you had known him all your life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think she&#8217;s going to let us stay.&#8221;</p>

<p>She came in again then, having taken off her
bonnet. &#8220;Will you come with me?&#8221; she said to
Volna, who rose. &#8220;The Father&#8217;s dressing room is
through there, sir,&#8221; she added to me, pointing to a
door.</p>

<p>I made use of it promptly; washed and shaved
and did what I could to make myself look less like
a tramp, before I returned to the good man&#8217;s study.</p>

<p>I must confess that the prospect of meeting him
was vastly less to my taste now than it had appeared
when we were twenty miles away; and I paced the
floor considerably ill at ease.</p>

<p>Presently Volna came in, looking as neat and
natty as if all the events of the past day and a half
were a dream.</p>

<p>&#8220;How on earth have you managed it?&#8221; I cried,
gazing at her in sheer admiration.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is the dearest old soul in whom nature
ever planted the curiosity of a woman. She just
fussed over me as though she was a hen and I her
one chicken.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You look as though you hadn&#8217;t had anything to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
make you turn a hair for the last fortnight. The
way you girls manage these renovations always
beats me. Twenty miles away you said you wanted
to go to bed; and here you are as fresh as paint.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You said that before; but it isn&#8217;t paint,&#8221; she
answered. &#8220;I&#8217;ve another feeling now than a desire
to sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So have I&mdash;disinclination to meet the priest.
Is that what you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed and shook her head. &#8220;No, indeed,
I mean a desire to eat. I was never so hungry in
my life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a very human feeling; but I wish you
hadn&#8217;t said anything about it,&#8221; I replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a very human individual, if it comes to
that. I declare I could even relish some of that
awful woman&#8217;s black bread.&#8221;</p>

<p>Most aptly the housekeeper came to tell us she
had prepared some breakfast for us in the opposite
room. &#8220;The good Father would have wished this,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;It is the best I can do for the moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eggs, ham, potted meats, good white wheaten
bread, butter and delicious coffee needed no sort of
apology. It was like a feast for the gods in our
famished eyes; and down we sat at once. We had
nearly finished and were lingering over the coffee
and laughing carelessly together at something which
Volna had said&mdash;I had my cup in my hand, I
remember&mdash;when the door was opened all unexpectedly
and the priest entered.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think I ever felt so foolish and confused<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
in my life. I set the cup down, flushed to the roots
of my hair, and rose with a most shame-faced,
down-at-heel manner, stammering some kind of
apology, as I met his grave, protesting, surprised
look.</p>

<p>But Volna came to the rescue with magnificent
self-possession. Girls have these inspirations and
beat us hollow in such cases. Without a sign of
awkwardness or self-consciousness she rose and
went up to him, smiling winsomely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Father Ambrose, I am in sore trouble and have
come to ask my dear mother&#8217;s old friend to help
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was an inspiration. Nothing less. All the
protest died out of his eyes in the softened look of
puzzled inquiry he bent on her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your mother?&#8221; he repeated, so gently.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am Volna Drakona.&#8221; He turned toward me.
&#8220;That was not the truth we told you yesterday.
Before you condemn us, hear all our story. My
mother&#8217;s peril was the reason. You will listen to
me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not understand, but your mother&#8217;s child
could never appeal to me for a hearing in vain.
And this gentleman?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is Mr. Robert Anstruther, an Englishman,
who has risked his liberty and his life to help me.&#8221;</p>

<p>I saw that this partial explanation only added to
the good man&#8217;s utter bewilderment. He stood
looking from one to the other of us and then passed
his hand slowly across his brow. Next he laid it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
gently on Volna&#8217;s head and smoothed her hair while
he gazed into her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you must be her daughter. Come to my
study and just tell me everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>He opened the door for her and I was following
when he turned and said courteously but with
unmistakable significance: &#8220;I will speak with you
afterwards, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the door closed on them.</p>

<small>&#8220;SHE IS BETROTHED&#8221;</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">I &nbsp;WAS by no means sorry that Father Ambrose
preferred to see Volna alone. It was her influence,
not mine, which would have any effect
upon him; and it was certain she would be able to
exert that influence better alone than if I were
present at the interview.</p>

<p>I judged, too, that the priest was shrewd enough
to see the wisdom of hearing our story from us
separately. I had already told him one falsehood
and Volna had acquiesced in it; so that we could
not blame him for using any caution which his
suspicions might prompt.</p>

<p>That she would win him round to her side, I had
little doubt. My faith in her made me very confident.
But what would he do then? What could
he do? How could he, a mere parish priest, help
us to turn our failure into success and get those
papers to Cracow?</p>

<p>I had ample time to meditate upon this, for it
was more than an hour before he came back to me.
He looked exceedingly grave and troubled, and
asked me to go to his study. Volna was not there.
He took his seat at his writing-table and waved
me to one opposite to him; and for a moment or
two he said nothing.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>I felt very uncomfortable. Somewhat as I used
to feel in the old Corpus days when carpeted by the
Head. He pressed his finger tips together, and
when he spoke there was a mixture of censure and
kindness in his tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Anstruther, I don&#8217;t know how you regard
the falsehood you told me yesterday and induced
my friend&#8217;s child to act?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was on the impulse of the moment, and I am
compelled to admit it was only one of many I have
had to tell in the last two days. But don&#8217;t think it
is my habit to lie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your name is really Robert Anstruther.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. But I can give you no proof. My papers
were taken&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He interrupted with a wave of the hand. &#8220;I
know. I am aware that I must take your word.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have perhaps deserved that word &#8216;must,&#8217; but
it rankles. If you feel that my action yesterday
prevents your believing what I tell you, we may as
well close this conversation at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Spoken hastily, like a young man, but not
unnatural, perhaps, in the circumstances. That you
should have deceived me with such ready speciousness
is scarcely calculated, however, to convince me
of your good faith. Perhaps you can appreciate
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>His cold tone and calm clear glance emphasized
this, and it hurt. I made no reply and dropped my
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you see that?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>&#8220;You are quite entitled to take your own view of
it, of course. But if the conditions were repeated,
I should probably do it again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you would do very wrong, Mr. Anstruther,&#8221;
he said, with some warmth. &#8220;A falsehood
is not only a sin in the eyes of the church, but
wrong in every way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I daresay you are quite right. I have never
tried it as a policy before, and it has landed us in a
pretty bad mess. But if you can show me how we
could have got out of the hands of the police without
lying, I&#8217;ll listen readily. And if we had got
into them, the mess would have been much worse
than it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you had been candid with me yesterday, all
the troubles since then would have been avoided.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They would also have been avoided if the storm
had not overtaken us and we had not lost our way.
But can we do any good by dissecting causes? I
am man enough I hope not to shirk responsibility
for my acts. I take all these lies on my own shoulders.
They appeared to be necessary. The necessity
no longer exists, and I shall tell you none. If
you can&#8217;t believe me, there is an end of things.
That&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>He sat for perhaps a minute frowning in thoughtful
silence. &#8220;Will you tell me exactly all that has
occurred?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Has Volna told you?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; but I wish to hear it from you also.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A natural precaution,&#8221; I admitted; and then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
told him as succinctly as I could everything from
the moment of the meeting at Bratinsk station.</p>

<p>He listened very closely, interposing some questions
now and then, and when I finished lapsed into
thought again.</p>

<p>Presently, with a smile, he said: &#8220;You have left
some things unmentioned.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not intentionally.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Descriptive of your own acts in places&mdash;at
least, as told to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have said all that need be said. Volna may
take an exaggerated view of some things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I have done you an injustice, Mr.
Anstruther.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is of no consequence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me, why did you plunge into this hazardous
matter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think that matters. Put it that I liked
the prospect of an adventure. That is quite true.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it all the truth?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no falsehood in it, Father. We&#8217;ll leave
it there, please.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at me very earnestly indeed and then
held out his hand. &#8220;Will you let me beg your
pardon?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>I grasped the hand cordially and shook my head.
&#8220;No, I will not. If I had been in your place I
should have been much more suspicious. You hurt
me when you thought I might lie to you. But you
see now that I shall not. And that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The child is very dear to me for her mother&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
sake, and I see that you had absolutely nothing to
expect in helping her except the risk and danger
that you ran.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I ran no risk. I have powerful and very influential
friends who will see me through all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That I did not understand,&#8221; he said quickly.
&#8220;It makes a difference. It will be easier.&#8221; He
spoke rather to himself than to me it seemed. &#8220;You
are sure you can rely upon your friends?&#8221; he asked
presently.</p>

<p>&#8220;My father carried through some large financial
matters for the German Government from time to
time, and I myself have had evidence of the good
will of several men high in office in Berlin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But this is Russia, Mr. Anstruther.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True, but their influence would not stop at the
frontier. You may take it from me, I am in no
sort of danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are your plans?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To get those papers through to Cracow. How,
may depend upon you in some measure.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused and then said slowly: &#8220;They are on
their way already.&#8221;</p>

<p>I sat up in intense surprise. &#8220;On their way?
Why, has&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He understood the unfinished question and
smiled. &#8220;No, she has not taken them. But they
will be in Cracow to-night. A day has been lost&mdash;precious
hours, perhaps&mdash;by your action yesterday.&#8221;</p>

<p>I drew a deep breath of bewilderment.</p>

<p>&#8220;You do not understand the wide-reaching influence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
of the Fraternity, Mr. Anstruther, and had
better ask no questions. But now that the papers
are gone, what are your plans?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had not got as far as that. I have none.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will wish to return to England?&#8221;</p>

<p>I hesitated. There was something behind his
question I could not read. &#8220;I suppose so&mdash;yes, of
course I shall return there. My home is there.&#8221;</p>

<p>He bent a kind but searching look on me. &#8220;I
hope you think I am your friend as well as&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
he said after a pause, leaving the sentence unfinished.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes indeed. I should be sorry not to think
so. Is&mdash;is Volna going home to Warsaw?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you been quite frank with me? I don&#8217;t
mean that unkindly,&#8221; he hastened to add in reply
to a start from me. &#8220;As to your motive in all
this? It will be best to be quite frank. Young
folks are young folks all the world over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should be sorry to misunderstand you,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You entered into this thing from love&mdash;of adventure
only?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As it is over, does my motive matter?&#8221;</p>

<p>He shook his head slowly. &#8220;It may. It may.
I don&#8217;t know. It may. I am so afraid of appearing
impertinent, or of making a mistake. We old
people fall so readily into mistakes,&#8221; he said with
a deprecating smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think the best way to avoid them is
to speak plainly?&#8221;</p>

<p>He picked up a sheet of paper and played with it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
with a suggestion of nervousness. &#8220;I am tempted
to tell you a story, a chapter of my life, Mr. Anstruther.
I was not originally intended for the
priesthood; but was to have married. I was betrothed,
in fact. Then something happened&mdash;the
result of misunderstanding&mdash;I knew afterwards
how easily it could have been avoided, but it was
not avoided; other influences intervened, and&mdash;and
so the marriage which took place was not mine;
and I am now a priest with just a memory. Does
that incline you to any special frankness with me
as to your motives in this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean with regard to Volna?&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at me again very intently. &#8220;You
know that she is betrothed?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes. She told me her uncle&#8217;s plans.&#8221;</p>

<p>His look now was more sympathetic and kind
than searching; and he sighed. &#8220;Ah, you do not
know, I see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not a child, Father Ambrose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can say no more. I ought not, perhaps, to
have said so much. I am going to deal with you
as a man, Mr. Anstruther. Of course all that has
occurred in these two days must never be mentioned.
The dear child&#8217;s future must not be compromised.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will not pass my lips.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You and I together can secure her safety; I am
going to ask your help. She will remain here until
I can get her back safely to Warsaw.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will do anything to secure her safety.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>&#8220;The one thing you can do is to put yourself in
the hands of the police.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The police?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You say your friends will help you in any
explanation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t follow you yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The police have tracked you here from Bratinsk.
They were in the village yesterday evening.
They are coming to me again this afternoon. It
happens that my housekeeper&#8217;s niece was to have
come here to-day&mdash;in a village like this all private
matters are public, you know. She is not coming,
but Volna can take her place for the time without
any suspicion being aroused. What you have to do
is to cause the police to believe that Volna has
crossed the frontier with you and that you have returned
alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How cause them to believe this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go and get your horse and ride through the
village this afternoon and call here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here!&#8221; I cried in astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I shall then send for the police agents
and hand you over to them, as the man who told me
the falsehoods yesterday. This will clear this house
of the danger of any suspicion.&#8221;</p>

<p>I could not restrain a smile, remembering how he
had emphasized the heinousness of falsehoods. &#8220;It
will at least be in a good cause,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;God forgive me&mdash;but the child must be saved,
Mr. Anstruther. You&#8217;ll do this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, of course.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>&#8220;And when your trouble is over, you will go to
England?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One thing at a time. They might send me to
Siberia.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be best so,&#8221; he said earnestly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What? Siberia for me?&#8221; I laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no. God forbid. England&mdash;England as
soon as you can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Volna? Does she&mdash;know of this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, no. Her one thought is of the trouble
she may already have brought upon you. She would
never agree to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>I believed that. &#8220;Should I&mdash;see her to&mdash;to say
good-bye?&#8221;</p>

<p>This perplexed him. &#8220;It would be better not,
but&#8221;&mdash;his eyes wandered all round the room before
he finished&mdash;&#8220;I suppose she would wish it. And
you won&#8217;t meet again and&mdash;and you&#8217;ll tell her you
are going home to England?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you must leave it to me what to
say,&#8221; I replied, with a smile. &#8220;I think you may
trust my discretion. And you must do your part
afterwards carefully. Keep her out of the way
when we play the comedy of that arrest later, or
she may cast herself for a part in it. She&#8217;s plucky
enough to avow herself, and that would mix things
up a good deal for us all, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>He frowned, threw up his hands in troubled perplexity
and pushed his chair back.</p>

<p>&#8220;We had better get it over,&#8221; he exclaimed
resignedly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll go and tell her you are leaving.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>He walked toward the door, paused, and turned
as if to say something more, then tossed up his
hands again and went out of the room.</p>

<p>I stared out of the window into the small, but
carefully tended garden, a prey to the very mixed
thoughts which the good Father had succeeded in
rousing.</p>

<p>Then the door opened and Volna came in alone.</p>

<small>VOLNA IS A LITTLE REFRACTORY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SHE was dressed for her new character of the
housekeeper&#8217;s niece, and wore a white apron
and a peasant girl&#8217;s picturesque head-dress.</p>

<p>She closed the door behind her, dropped me a
little curtsey and said with the demurest of glances:
&#8220;Did you please to send for me, sir?&#8221; Then she
burst out laughing and ran to me, both hands outstretched,
as though we had not met for a long time.
&#8220;Now, wasn&#8217;t my instinct right?&#8221;</p>

<p>I held her hands apart while I surveyed her costume.
&#8220;Who was ever so foolish as to question
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And isn&#8217;t the Father just the dearest old man
in the world?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The world is a big place and there are lots of
old men in it,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;But I knew you
would win him round. He had no chance against
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed gaily. &#8220;He lectured me, however.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So he did me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And to think that if we had only known, he
would have taken care of those papers yesterday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And have saved us from all the horrors of last
night.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>She shot a glance at me. &#8220;And have freed you
from the encumbrance of a very troublesome sister
twenty-four hours ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed; if we had only known.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re in a very agreeing mood.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am no longer a brother and must be polite.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you call that politeness?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Politeness or&mdash;policy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, whichever it is, it&#8217;s not a bit nice. Not
a bit like&mdash;Bob.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You forget. Bob is my own name, as well as
my friend Garrett&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How formal you are. What is the matter?
You can&#8217;t be annoyed about anything Father Ambrose
has said to you? Nor about his having
helped us? What is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t even know I was formal.&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned away to the priest&#8217;s table and sat in
his chair turning over the books on the desk. I sat
facing her as I had faced the priest. Once she
sighed, and once shrugged her shoulders, and twice
glanced across at me in perplexity.</p>

<p>She was very pretty; very bewitching; more
pretty and bewitching than ever, in my eyes; but
I was conscious of a new restraint&mdash;a something
like a barrier between us which had not been there
before. I couldn&#8217;t speak with the old freedom; in
fact, I could think of nothing to say.</p>

<p>&#8220;Father Ambrose tells me you are going away,&#8221;
she said at length, her fingers still busy with the
books.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>&#8220;Yes, I am going away. I&mdash;I thought you&#8217;d
like me just to say good-bye.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I should hope so, indeed. After what
you&#8217;ve done for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind about that, please. I think I must
be off.&#8221;</p>

<p>I rose; but she paid no heed, just sitting on at
the table, her face averted and her fingers moving
the books restlessly. I looked out of the window,
fidgetted a moment, and then turned again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I think it&#8217;s time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I won&#8217;t keep you,&#8221; she said then;
very stiffly and without looking at me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye then.&#8221;</p>

<p>She rose and held out her hand. &#8220;Good-bye.&#8221;
She turned her face to me and her lip quivered as
she bit it. I recalled the priest&#8217;s words about her
betrothal; and clamped down my feelings as I took
her hand and pressed it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you God-speed with all my heart,&#8221; I
said.</p>

<p>She lowered her eyes again and her hand fell
listlessly as I released it and turned to the door.
I had nearly reached it when I heard the rustle of
her cotton dress and turned to find her at my elbow.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;re not going to part like this?&#8221;</p>

<p>I should have liked to part in a very different
fashion could I have had my way. But I could
not.</p>

<p>&#8220;Father Ambrose thinks that I had better go;
and of course he is right.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>&#8220;But Bob and Peggy haven&#8217;t said good-bye.
Oh, think of all we&#8217;ve gone through together. Don&#8217;t
go away angry with me like this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Angry! God forbid. Why you&#8217;re just the
bravest little soul I ever met in all my life. And
some day I hope Sylvia and you will meet, and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
I scarcely knew what I was saying and
ended in partial incoherence.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s more like you. I mean it&#8217;s more natural,
except that you generally know exactly what you
want to say and say it. Are you going to&mdash;to
England?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I <i>have</i> any definite plans. I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Her laughter stopped me. She shook her forefinger
with laughing assumption of gravity. &#8220;If I
had not ceased to be Peggy, I should say you were
hiding something from me. And you know how
true Peggy&#8217;s instincts are?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What should I have to hide?&#8221; I asked with
a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a mask of a smile,&#8221; she cried, with a lifting
of the hands. &#8220;Father Ambrose is a wonderful
man; he has changed you completely in an
hour.&#8221; She turned back to the table and sat down
again. &#8220;I suppose it couldn&#8217;t be helped,&#8221; she added
half to herself with a sigh.</p>

<p>&#8220;What could not be helped?&#8221;</p>

<p>She did not reply at once but looked up at me
from under her long lashes, while her feet tapped
the floor quickly and irritably. &#8220;Of course you are
doing this with a purpose,&#8221; she said after the pause.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
&#8220;Why? Oh, don&#8217;t pretend to misunderstand me.
You know as well as I do that you&#8217;re entirely
changed. It&#8217;s so unjust. What have I done? You
know that after all you&#8217;ve done for me I wouldn&#8217;t
do anything to anger you for all the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t persist about my being angry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, offended, then, only it&#8217;s such a stupid
word. Estranged, alienated, changed; any word
you like. Something has happened&mdash;something
has come between us. Do you treat Sylvia like
this? It&#8217;s maddening.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no change in me,&#8221; I protested.</p>

<p>She laughed. &#8220;It&#8217;s in me, then, you mean.
That&#8217;s almost cowardly&mdash;at least it would be if
any one but you said it.&#8221; Then with a start her
eyes opened wide; she rose and stared at me with
parted lips; and a vivid blush spread all over her
face. &#8220;I believe I understand. You think in your
English way, that I have been too forward, unwomanly,
too,&mdash;oh!&#8221; and she covered her crimson
cheeks with her white strenuous fingers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say that, please. Why the time we&#8217;ve
been together has been the brightest thing in the
world to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>She took her hands from her face and sat down
again staring at the table while the flush died out
of her cheeks slowly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve gone all over that
sentence. That &#8216;has been&#8217; is the clue. Now I see.
It&#8217;s all over and we are conventional again.&#8221; With
an exaggerated affectation of a society manner she
rose very slowly, held out her hand and simpered:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
&#8220;I hope you will have a pleasant journey, Mr. Anstruther.
The weather is still open enough to be
excellent for travelling. Will you make my compliments
to your sister, and say I hope to see her
some day?&#8221;</p>

<p>I could not restrain a smile, but not a muscle of
her face moved; she kept up the vapid simper. &#8220;I
will give your message,&#8221; I said, and tried to take
her hand; but she just let me touch her finger tips
and then bowed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am so pleased to have met you; and thank
you <i>so</i> much for all you have done. I hope you&#8217;ll
not take cold from the rain. Colds are <i>such</i> distressing
afflictions.&#8221; Then another sudden change.
With a stamp of her foot she threw her head back
and her rich blue eyes sparkled. &#8220;Is that better?&#8221;</p>

<p>I bowed. &#8220;I am sorry you so misunderstand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Misunderstand!&#8221; she repeated, quickly. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t misunderstand that if you were the kind of
masculine formality you have been acting here this
morning you would never have done what you have
for me in the last two days. I am only a woman, of
course&mdash;wait, you will wish to see Father Ambrose
again before you go. I&#8217;ll tell him;&#8221; and she crossed
to the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye,&#8221; I said, but she paid no heed and
went out of the room. It was not the kind of parting
I had looked for, but I smothered my regrets.
It was better so.</p>

<p>We could not go on being Bob and Peggy to one
another of course; and yet we had been too closely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
associated to drop back into mere formal friendliness
again without a wrench. She couldn&#8217;t see this
in a moment; but she would understand it later;
and&mdash;well, the sooner I was away, the better for
my peace of mind.</p>

<p>Then she came back bringing the priest with her.
He was very plastic clay in her white young hands.
He wore a look of deep and almost comical perplexity,
and was obviously very ill at ease.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Father, please. What have you said or
done to Mr. Anstruther to change him in this short
time?&#8221;</p>

<p>He glanced half appealingly at me; but I was as
little at ease as he was. &#8220;My dear child, I&mdash;I&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have lectured me already on the wisdom
and necessity of complete frankness, Father,&#8221; she
interposed significantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is very difficult to gather&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he got no
farther, for she held up a warning finger and shook
it at him with a laugh and then placed it on his
lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;There shall not be any difficulty,&#8221; she declared.
&#8220;For two days Mr. Anstruther has been just like
a brother to me; treating me perfectly frankly and
saying as candidly as any brother whatever was in
his thoughts. We made a compact that he should
do that, and he kept it honestly. I left him in that
mood when I first saw you. You then had a long
talk with him and I found him entirely changed;
keeping something from me; formal in manner;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
saying things he didn&#8217;t mean and meaning others
he didn&#8217;t say. Instead of a brother, he was an
acquaintance. You caused this by something you
said. Now tell me, please.&#8221;</p>

<p>The good man was helpless; so I went to the
rescue. &#8220;It is time for me to go. You can discuss
this when I have left.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a moment. Two things I am certain of.
You two have arranged to do something that affects
me and you won&#8217;t tell me; and you, Father, have
said something about me which has changed Mr.
Anstruther. I won&#8217;t stand that. I won&#8217;t let him
go as if we were just how-d&#8217;ye-do&mdash;and&mdash;good-bye
acquaintances. He has saved me from prison, and
I just can&#8217;t do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The embarrassment was becoming almost painful.
&#8220;I should never think of you as a mere acquaintance;
but please let me go,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. You may go. Good-bye&mdash;but don&#8217;t
attempt to help me any more if you <i>do</i> go in that
way. I will not let either of you help me, if you
mean to deceive me;&#8221; and with fingers that trembled
she took off the head-dress and laid aside her
apron. &#8220;If you will not tell me, I will go by myself
and take my chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear child,&#8221; protested the priest.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will. I will. My mind is made up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You had better tell her,&#8221; I said to the priest
then.</p>

<p>She smiled, but through the promise of tears.
&#8220;You know me, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>Father Ambrose then told her the scheme in regard
to my arrest and we both enlarged upon the
absence of risk to me. She neither acquiesced nor
vetoed it. &#8220;That&#8217;s number one. What is number
two? What have you told Mr. Anstruther?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You want to rule with a pretty strong iron rod,
don&#8217;t you?&#8221; I said. &#8220;But there is nothing to tell
that need be told.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me,&#8221; she cried to Father Ambrose. &#8220;I
will know, or&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I only told him such facts about you as you had
told me,&#8221; complied the priest, taking refuge in
generalities.</p>

<p>She stood thinking, shooting quick inquiring
glances at us in turn.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ask you not to insist on anything more than
that,&#8221; I urged.</p>

<p>A gleam of understanding was in her eyes and a
semi-mischievous smile hovering about her lips as
she returned: &#8220;Who asked that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bob Garrett,&#8221; I declared promptly.</p>

<p>The smile deepened. &#8220;What will the police do
with him?&#8221; she asked Father Ambrose. &#8220;Take
him to Cracow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;More probably to Warsaw,&#8221; was the reply;
&#8220;but as we told you, his friends will see he comes
to no harm of any sort. You are quite sure of that,
are you not, Mr. Anstruther?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t the faintest doubt of it;&#8221; and at this
Volna looked quite her happy self.</p>

<p>&#8220;I may as well put these on again, then,&#8221; she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
said, and she slipped on the apron and arranged the
quaint head-dress. When she looked next at me
her face was almost preternaturally grave, except
her expressionful eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see now what a lot of time would have
been saved if you had been frank like Bob, and not
tried to deceive me like Mr. Anstruther. I can say
good-bye, just as formally as you please, now I
know why you are going.&#8221;</p>

<p>I took her hand and pressed it. &#8220;You&#8217;ll stay
here and let this thing go through all right?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Father Ambrose wishes it. Good-bye,
Mr. Anstruther, and good-bye&mdash;Bob.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye&mdash;Peggy. I may say that for the last
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, for the last time, of course. I am Volna,
after to-day.&#8221; She looked into my eyes with an
odd inscrutable expression in hers and smiled.
&#8220;You&#8217;ll be all right, or else I shouldn&#8217;t agree. But
I know you, and I am sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then I hurried out of the room followed by the
priest.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br />


<small>THE ARREST</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AS it was desirable for the success of our plan
that I should not be seen when I fetched my
horse, the priest pointed out a way across the fields;
and then gave me one of the greatest surprises of
that time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Considering what you are doing I must trust
you with a dangerous secret. You will give me
your honour never to reveal it?&#8221;</p>

<p>I gave him the pledge readily.</p>

<p>&#8220;The owner of the shed where you left the horses
is named Jacob Posen; and he may have found
them, and raise difficulties. In that case you will
say to him; &#8216;I am a peasant farmer, friend.&#8217; He
will probably reply; &#8216;You seem in a hurry?&#8217; and
you will answer: &#8216;Immediate.&#8217; His next question
if he asks it, will be: &#8216;Your name?&#8217; In reply you
will raise your left hand with the forefinger extended,
the tip to be level with your eyes, and the
back of the hand toward him, and say: &#8216;In the eye of
God.&#8217; He will then offer to shake hands with you;
but you will refuse and look steadily at him. He
will then be ready to help you.&#8221; He illustrated the
peculiar gesture.</p>

<p>The inner significance of this was not difficult to
see. &#8220;Peasant farmer, friend,&#8221; clearly stood for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
&#8220;P. F. F.&#8221;&mdash;the Polish Freedom Fraternity. The
word &#8220;Immediate&#8221; was for one with a similar
initial&mdash;probably Independence; while the gesture
was for recognition purposes with a subtle reference
to the righteousness of the cause and the far-reaching
extent of the movement.</p>

<p>I was profoundly impressed by the incident.
Here I was in a little village of nowhere, far removed
from the busy cities where revolution has its
birth and conspiracy is cradled; and yet the ramifications
were so widespread, the arrangements so
perfected, and the secret means so ready to hand,
that Father Ambrose&mdash;as mild a mannered man as
ever wore a priest&#8217;s stole&mdash;was able in a few minutes
to find one agent to carry the dangerous papers
to Cracow, and then another to help me in my
scheme.</p>

<p>Until then I had never regarded the Fraternity
as a serious national force; my opinion being influenced
by the fact that my friend, Count Ladislas,
was one of the leaders.</p>

<p>I knew him for a man whose habit of mind led
him to shirk responsibility, to act on impulse, to be
swayed by the last word, and to veer this way and
that when a decision had to be made. It was
impossible to think of him as leading a movement
which called for practical, earnest and sustained
effort, for the resolute overcoming of innumerable
difficulties, the persistent, steady, battling against
odds, and the uninterrupted, unceasing educative
work needed here.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>He was a man of dreams, ideas, theories, and
principles; and here were the results of steady
action, hard work, stern realities and tireless
practice.</p>

<p>I seemed to realize for the first time how real was
the danger from which Volna had to be saved and
how grave the risk to which her friends in Warsaw
had so thoughtlessly exposed her.</p>

<p>Even if our little scheme now were successful and
I managed to lead the police off her track, there was
serious reason to fear that fresh danger might await
her in Warsaw; and at that moment a thought
occurred to me and, despite the seriousness of
things, I laughed aloud.</p>

<p>In our last interview she had shewn a dozen
moods in as many sentences, to my infinite bewilderment;
but I thought now of something which
had escaped me at the moment. Her cheerfulness
had returned when she knew I was likely to be taken
to Warsaw.</p>

<p>Will any one blame me if in my egoism I interpreted
this as a sign that she hoped we should meet
again there? We had parted for always and said
a last good-bye; but she had taken the parting
lightly, because the &#8220;always&#8221; would last only until
we were both in Warsaw. That was why I laughed.</p>

<p>The laughter had a short life, however. It died
suddenly as I remembered how Father Ambrose had
spoken of Volna&#8217;s betrothal. There was something
more than I knew of in that; Volna herself had
spoken of an entanglement; and I was worrying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
over the puzzle when I reached the top of a sloping
meadow and saw below me the shed I was seeking.</p>

<p>There was no one about as I hurried down the
hill. I was glad, as I had no mind for indulgence
in cabalistic signs, and all the rest of it.</p>

<p>But I had been seen; and as I was unfastening the
door a man came round the end of the shed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; A very blunt but significant monosyllable.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you Jacob Posen?&#8221; He nodded. He was
a big, heavy, black-bearded, powerful man.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have come for my horse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean? This is my barn. I have
no horse of yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am a peasant farmer, friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed, giving no sign that he understood;
but he was only acting, for he said with a sneer:
&#8220;You seem in a hurry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Immediate.&#8221;</p>

<p>His laugh changed to a scowl and he growled in
a tone of almost savage anger, &#8220;Your name?&#8221;
I was almost surprised an oath did not follow.</p>

<p>I made the sign and answered, &#8220;In the eye of
God.&#8221;</p>

<p>His face changed suddenly and affecting an air of
good fellowship he thrust out his hand. I refused
it and just looked him in the face.</p>

<p>His taciturn expression returned and he opened
the door of the barn.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw you put them both in and wondered,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;Shall I fetch the saddle or will you?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>&#8220;Better you; I don&#8217;t wish to be seen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Both?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, mine only. Hide the other and the horse.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went off at once leaving me marvelling more
than ever. He was soon back and himself slipped
on the saddle and bridle. Nothing more was said
until I was ready to mount.</p>

<p>&#8220;You bought him in Bratinsk and this in Pulta.
What shall I do with it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It mustn&#8217;t be found twenty miles west of here;
and this revolver must be hidden,&#8221; I added, as I
gave him the weapon I had taken at Schirmskad.</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand. God keep us all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God keep us all,&#8221; I repeated, assuming that to
be another secret sign. As I rode off, I saw him
return to the coppice where the other saddle was
and carry it back to the barn.</p>

<p>I rode leisurely in the direction of the village, on
the look-out for some sign of the police and running
over in my mind the story I should tell.</p>

<p>Such of the villagers as were about gaped at me
and two or three children followed. As I was playing
a part and did not know whose eyes might be
upon me, I thought it best to play thoroughly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Which is the priest&#8217;s house?&#8221; I asked one of
the women; and she pointed it out. I beckoned
to the children and throwing them some kopecks
bade them tell the Father I wished to speak to him.</p>

<p>He came out and I raised my hat and said in a
voice loud enough for others to hear: &#8220;I am the
Englishman who passed through the village yesterday<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
and spoke with you, Father. I have had all my
money taken from me and have thought it best to
come to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come into the house,&#8221; he said gravely. As I
dismounted and fastened my horse to the railing,
he drew a woman aside and whispered to her; then
led the way to the door. &#8220;I have sent for the police
agents,&#8221; he told me. &#8220;They have been some half
hour in the village.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am quite ready;&#8221; and as we sat waiting I
told him hurriedly what had passed with Jacob
Posen, and that I thought Volna&#8217;s horse should be
hidden.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you really need any money?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I think not. I shall get back my letter of
credit.&#8221;</p>

<p>Soon we heard footsteps outside.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are here. I almost regret this,&#8221; he said
hurriedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it splendid. Now for the play.&#8221; Then
I raised my voice, and spoke excitedly. &#8220;The men
took my letter of credit, and if you do not help me
what am I to do? Some one shall pay for this.&#8221;
I got up and held the door partly open. &#8220;If you
can&#8217;t do it, you can&#8217;t of course; but I daren&#8217;t stay
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You cannot go,&#8221; said the Father. &#8220;I have sent
for the police.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not go, I&#8217;ll see about that,&#8221; I cried angrily,
and rushed out to be instantly seized by my friend
of the Devil&#8217;s Staircase and a companion.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>&#8220;No, no. We&#8217;ll see about your going,&#8221; sneered
the fellow. &#8220;You&#8217;re right, Father Ambrose, this
is the man we seek. Thank you for keeping him
here and sending for us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, so it&#8217;s you again, eh?&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; and you won&#8217;t get away this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>I turned on the priest viciously. &#8220;And this is
your idea of Christianity, eh? To get me inside
your house in order to betray me to the hounds. I
wish you joy of your creed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t insult the Father. He has only done his
duty.&#8221; The irony of the praise for the falsehood
we had acted together, struck the good man and I
saw him wince.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have done what I have done,&#8221; he murmured.</p>

<p>&#8220;See if he&#8217;s armed,&#8221; ordered the agent. &#8220;He
stole my revolver.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your comrades took it from me in their turn.
You&#8217;ll find it at Schirmskad. I&#8217;m not armed. I
don&#8217;t need any weapons any longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked up with a scowl, and a start. &#8220;Schirmskad?&#8221;</p>

<p>I laughed significantly. &#8220;On my way to the
frontier. You&#8217;re too late, my friend; and within
the next few hours I am going to show you what
a fool you&#8217;ve made of yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the woman?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wire to Schirmskad and ask who escaped when
the cottage of woodcutter Krempel was burned
down last night. You know how near that is to the
frontier.&#8221; I did not, but I bluffed him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>&#8220;Did he ride up alone?&#8221; he asked Father
Ambrose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, at the moment I sent for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll answer for this,&#8221; he cried angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s exactly what I&#8217;ve ridden back for.
Your fellows at that cottage took my money and
papers; so, as soon as I had done what I set out
to do, I rode back. On my way I came to this priest
here; as he knows I am an Englishman; and instead
of helping me, he arranged for my arrest. You
Russian Poles are a nice friendly Christian people,
the whole lot of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where were you going?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why to Bratinsk, of course&mdash;where the rest of
my things are and I am well enough known to
borrow money until I can get some from England.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A likely story,&#8221; he sneered.</p>

<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t believe it. Your sneers don&#8217;t
affect me a kopeck. This particular episode being
closed I am going back to my hunting at Bratinsk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll find the episode, as you call it, isn&#8217;t
closed. You&#8217;ll have to answer for it and must come
with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t the least objection now.&#8221;</p>

<p>He thanked Father Ambrose again and we left
the house. They walked one on each side of me,
and one of the villagers led my horse. In this way
I was marched to the police quarters of the village&mdash;just
a cottage, pretty much like that of an ordinary
county policeman at home.</p>

<p>There he wanted to catechize me afresh about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
Volna; but I stopped him. &#8220;I shall say nothing
about that and nothing more about myself. I am
ready to go wherever you please to take me, and
having no longer any reason to resist, will do what
you wish. You know who I am, because you saw
my papers at Bratinsk before any of this fuss
occurred. Take me to your superiors and I&#8217;ll convince
them in half an hour that the sooner I am at
liberty again, the better for all concerned.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am in charge of this,&#8221; he cried, bristling with
authority. &#8220;You have aided the escape of a revolutionary
and must answer for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am an Englishman. Take me to your superiors,&#8221;
I said; and to that phrase I stuck, repeating
it doggedly to his every question, until I had tired
out his patience and worn his temper to shreds.</p>

<p>I was then left in a room with a man to guard me
while a carriage was got ready; when I was handcuffed
and bundled into it pretty roughly. I
knew the road of course and soon saw they were
taking me to Solden.</p>

<p>I was carried to the police quarters there and
shut up in a cell; still with a man to guard me.
Meanwhile they communicated with the police at
Schirmskad; and after some time I was taken from
the cell and confronted with the chief of the men
who had nearly captured me at the woodcutter&#8217;s
cottage.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad to see you,&#8221; I told him. &#8220;You have
my passport, papers, and letter of credit. I demand
their return.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>&#8220;Where is your companion and who is she?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is the chief here?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Answer me, you dog,&#8221; he cried with an oath,
raising his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am an Englishman with very powerful
friends; no mere peasant to be kicked and hounded
by you. Lay a finger on me, if you dare.&#8221; The
two conferred together; my papers were taken out
and examined; and a third man called to the conference.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is your companion and who is she?&#8221;
demanded the man again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take me to your superiors,&#8221; I said; and from
that reply I would not be moved. At last I was
sent back to the cell with the guard to watch me as
before.</p>

<p>I was getting on better than I had even hoped.
My insistent repetition of the fact that I was an
Englishman had had its effect.</p>

<p>The Warsaw agent who had seen me first at
Bratinsk had no doubt satisfied himself on the point;
and from what I had seen in the recent conference,
he had made this clear to the others.</p>

<p>My chief anxiety was about food. It was now
late in the afternoon and having had nothing since
the breakfast at the priest&#8217;s house I was egregiously
hungry. I recalled my experience at Pulta station
and began to speculate what effect a gold coin would
have upon my guard. He was a heavy stupid-looking
fellow; but the biggest fool in Russia knows the
difference between a gold piece and a kopeck.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>The coins in my pocket had not been taken from
me and although I was still handcuffed I was able
to wriggle my hand into my pocket and get some
out. The man watched me sullenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am hungry,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Prisoners mustn&#8217;t talk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have had no food for hours. Wouldn&#8217;t this
buy some?&#8221; and I held up a couple of roubles.</p>

<p>&#8220;Silence,&#8221; he growled, with a surly frown.</p>

<p>I substituted a gold piece for the two silver ones.
&#8220;Food is perhaps dear in Solden.&#8221;</p>

<p>He fidgetted uneasily, his eyes on the gold. I
put the three coins together. &#8220;The silver for the
food, and gold for the waiter,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>He sighed regretfully. &#8220;Impossible,&#8221; he murmured.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mayn&#8217;t you buy food for yourself? Have you
had supper?&#8221;</p>

<p>His eyes gleamed. A slow smile of cunning
spread over his face. He stretched out his hand.
I put the two silver coins into it. &#8220;One pays the
waiter at the end of dinner.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was disappointed, and stood glancing from
the coins in the palm of his hand to me and back
from me to the coins. Then he decided to earn the
gold.</p>

<p>He knocked on the door of the cell and a comrade
came. They whispered together; the coins jingled;
and the comrade departed.</p>

<p>In half an hour he returned with some food: a
cold chicken, some bread and tea. The cost was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
probably under a rouble and the comrade had thus
paid himself in advance.</p>

<p>There was no knife; so I had to eat the fowl as
best I could; pulling the joints asunder and gnawing
the flesh. But I was too hungry to bother about
that. When I had finished I gave the man the gold
piece.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must give him something,&#8221; he grumbled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give him what you like out of that,&#8221; I answered,
getting a very black look from him.</p>

<p>After the food, sleep became insistent. I had not
slept since Pulta, and had done a good deal in the
meantime. I was as tired as a hound after a long
day, and had scarcely settled myself on the bench
against the corner of the wall before I was off.</p>

<p>Not for long, however. I dreamed that some
huge monster animal was suffocating me and woke
to find it was my guard&#8217;s heavy coat sleeve pressing
against my face as he leaned across to get at the
pocket where my money was.</p>

<p>&#8220;Helping yourself, are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>He got up hurriedly and a couple of coins fell
from his hand to the floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;I only wanted to see you were comfortable,&#8221; he
mumbled.</p>

<p>&#8220;You thought the money might make too big
a lump for comfort, eh? Very nice of you. Your
officer counted it, so you can tell him how much
you&#8217;ve taken. It&#8217;ll be all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>He swore&mdash;perhaps at the feebleness of the sarcasm;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
but he thrust the money back and sat down
in his chair again glowering at me.</p>

<p>I settled myself in my corner once more and slept
this time until somebody shook me violently.</p>

<p>It was my friend of the Devil&#8217;s Staircase; and he
bade me get up at once and go with him.</p>

<p>I yawned. &#8220;Where to?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To my superiors,&#8221; he answered with a grin;
thinking it a joke no doubt to throw my own words
back at me.</p>

<small>A TASTE OF PRISON LIFE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">OUTSIDE in the corridor the man from Schirmskad
was waiting, and the two drove me to
the railway station and hustled me into a railway
carriage. They would not say where I was being
taken, but I did not care much, and five minutes
after I entered the train, I was fast asleep.</p>

<p>When I awoke it was daylight. A bleak, desolate,
grey morning, for the snow had come at last, and
was falling heavily. I was cold and stiff from the
cramped position, and sore from the jolting of the
train&mdash;one never understands how a train can jolt
until after an experience in what they call a fast
train in Russian Poland&mdash;and as I sat up, yawned,
and rubbed my eyes, every bone in my body seemed
to ache.</p>

<p>My guards were both asleep. Had I been minded
I could have taken their weapons and shot
them both as they rolled in their corners, snoring
loudly enough to have drowned the sound of the
shots.</p>

<p>I roused them both, and with a great shew of
politeness told them what I could have done. They
both swore at me.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really very wrong of you to go to sleep in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
such a case,&#8221; I said amiably. &#8220;You had no right
to subject a prisoner to such a temptation. I fear
I shall be compelled to report you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a cool hand,&#8221; growled the Schirmskad
man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not nearly so cold as <i>you</i> would soon have been
if I had done it,&#8221; I retorted, and the grimness of the
joke seemed to appeal to them. &#8220;But Englishmen
don&#8217;t do that kind of thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To hell with the English,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not pretty, but it&#8217;s nothing to what you&#8217;ll
feel like saying before you are through with me.
One of you took me for a spy, or a conspirator, and
the other for a thief or a murderer. It was
brilliant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you, then?&#8221; growled the Warsaw
man. They were both sleepy and ill-tempered, and
thus very easy to bait.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I had been either spy or murderer, I suppose
even you can see that I should have shot you just
now instead of going on contentedly to explain
things.&#8221; The train ran through a station then, and
I caught sight of the name Tischnov. I knew the
place to be some twenty miles from Warsaw. I
began to chuckle, and presently burst into a loud
laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am thinking of your promotion,&#8221; I grinned.
&#8220;They tell me that the man who makes the biggest
mistakes gets promoted instantly for fear the
blunder should be known and police prestige suffer.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
I expect you&#8217;ll be heads of departments by to-morrow,
you two, with decorations.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve had enough of your insolence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You asked me why I smiled. Why, when your
Minister of the Interior hears from my dear old
friend, General von Eckerstein&mdash;he used to represent
Germany at Petersburg, you know&mdash;how you&#8217;ve
treated me, you&#8217;ll get such a sweet message from
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Schirmskad man swore, but his companion
looked serious. I continued to chaff them with much
enjoyment for ten miles; and the Warsaw agent
grew more and more uneasy at every word I
dropped relative to my having well-known friends.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you know about General von Eckerstein?&#8221;
he asked at length.</p>

<p>&#8220;That he doesn&#8217;t like his friends to wear this
kind of ornament;&#8221; and I held up my handcuffs.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ll give me your word not to escape, I&#8217;ll
take them off,&#8221; he replied, very sheepishly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not for the world, now. I shall be able to tell
the General how it feels to be dragged through the
streets of Warsaw manacled like a felon.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two whispered together for some minutes,
and then the Warsaw man said: &#8220;We&#8217;re not afraid
of your escaping. I&#8217;ll take them off.&#8221;</p>

<p>I let him do it, of course. &#8220;A bit uncomfortable
about it all, eh? It&#8217;s beginning to dawn on you at
last that I&#8217;m not a dangerous revolutionary?&#8221; I
said, as I rubbed my chafed wrists. &#8220;You&#8217;re only
at the beginning of your lesson, though.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>&#8220;I have done no more than my duty,&#8221; he muttered.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall see about that before the day&#8217;s over,
my friend,&#8221; I answered sharply.</p>

<p>When we reached Warsaw I was driven to the
police headquarters. I was expected, and after a
few minutes I was taken to a room where some half
dozen men were awaiting me, among them being
the two who had brought me to Warsaw. The
chief was sitting at a heavily bepapered table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stand there,&#8221; he said, pointing to a spot opposite
to him.</p>

<p>Two things were evident. The chief was a man
high in authority&mdash;the deferential manner of the
rest shewed this&mdash;and the proceedings were stage-managed
with a view to impress me with the solemnity
and seriousness of the occasion. I took my
cue accordingly, and was as nonchalant as I could
be. &#8220;Why stand?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a prisoner,&#8221; he rapped out, with a
frown.</p>

<p>&#8220;On what charge?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t question me. Your name?&#8221;</p>

<p>I looked at him steadily and kept silent. The
frown deepened and he repeated &#8220;Your name; do
you hear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I hear you; but if I am a prisoner I
decline to answer any questions until I know the
charge against me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t trifle with me. Refuse to answer and
you go to the cells.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>&#8220;That as you please. Your agent there knows
my name perfectly well and that I am a British
subject. I claim my rights as one.&#8221;</p>

<p>The reply only served to increase his anger. The
flesh about his nose and mouth began to grow white
as it will with some men in passion. He was a
bully, and probably hated the English like so many
of his countrymen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Answer me, you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; The epithet was lost in
the loud cough of a man near him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have the only answer I shall give until I
know the charge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take him away,&#8221; he ordered, with a wave of
the hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I demand to communicate with the British
Consul,&#8221; I said, &#8220;and with my friend, General von
Eckerstein.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take him away,&#8221; he repeated; and I was led
off and placed in a cell. If he thought to frighten
me, the effort had failed. He had put himself in
the wrong, and I knew that my turn would
come.</p>

<p>It was a filthy, foul-smelling place they put me
in, and they kept me in it all day without food or
even water.</p>

<p>In the evening I was taken again before the man,
and the scene of the morning was repeated in pretty
much the same terms and with the same result. But
my back was up, and I vowed I&#8217;d rather starve than
give in.</p>

<p>I passed a miserable night, famished with hunger,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
parched with thirst, and half stifled with the reeking
foulness of the place.</p>

<p>In the morning an official came to the cell to try
a different method. He was less of a ruffian than
his superior, and sought to convince me of the uselessness
of contumacity.</p>

<p>I let him talk without once replying to his questions
until he was in the act of leaving. &#8220;I am a
British subject,&#8221; I said then, &#8220;and I have demanded
no more than my rights. I have been treated like
a dog and shut up in this filthy place to be starved
into submission to that ruffianly bully. Go through
with it if you dare. I can keep my end up, and be
hanged to you all. But if I&#8217;m left to rot here,
there&#8217;ll be questions which somebody will find it difficult
to answer. You can&#8217;t murder Englishmen
with impunity. You know that.&#8221;</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders, hesitated whether to
answer, then decided not to and went away.</p>

<p>A couple of hours later I was taken again to be
examined, and the man who had visited me was
with the bully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is your name Robert Anstruther?&#8221; asked the
latter.</p>

<p>&#8220;You knew that before you sentenced me to
twenty-four hours&#8217; starvation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you prepared now to explain your part in
this business?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What business? What do you charge me
with?&#8221;</p>

<p>His colleague bent and whispered to him; and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
short but very heated altercation followed, which
resulted in the bully ordering the other man out of
the room.</p>

<p>Then he turned to me. &#8220;You&#8217;ll have to answer
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall see about that,&#8221; I returned with a grin.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall gaol you till you do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we shall both be a good deal older when
we meet again,&#8221; I retorted.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have a fancy to try a change of prisons?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I demand to see the British Consul and to be
allowed to communicate with my friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your friends, now. Who are they?&#8221; he
sneered.</p>

<p>&#8220;One will do to start with. His Excellency
General von Eckerstein of the German Legation at
Petersburg. I wish him to know that you have
tried to starve me to submit to your infernal
bullying.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Insolent English beast,&#8221; he roared, completely
losing his head in his fury. &#8220;Take the liar away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shan&#8217;t always be a prisoner,&#8221; I cried, as the
man seized me. &#8220;But I shall remember that insult
until I&#8217;ve made you swallow your words.&#8221; I was
nearly as furious as he; but I had no time to say
more, for the men took their cue from him and
hustled me violently out of the room.</p>

<p>They passed on word that I might be ill treated
with impunity; and I had a very rough and tumble
time indeed while being carried to one of the gaols.</p>

<p>With the minor police and gaol officials in Russian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
Poland, the ill-treatment of prisoners is a carefully
studied art; and they amused themselves congenially
with me. Twenty times on that short
journey I had to put the greatest restraint on myself
to resist the temptation to do what they strove to
goad me to do&mdash;to commit some act of violence
which would have given them the excuse they sought
to half batter me to death.</p>

<p>As it was I was hustled, struck and kicked; my
clothes were nearly torn off my back, and every foul
epithet which Russian and Polish malice could think
of was spat at me with official brutality and contemptuousness.</p>

<p>I kept my head, however. I was tough enough
to bear a good deal of ill-treatment; I had often
taken much worse punishment in the boxing ring,
and I had played football in America; so I held my
temper back for the man who was the real cause of
it all.</p>

<p>They flung me at length into a cell and locked
the door upon me with a last gibe that the English
were dirty cowards, and I the meanest skunk of
them all.</p>

<p>I understood that day how men are made murderers.
I brooded over my wrongs and nursed my
rage against the bully who was responsible for this
treatment, until if we had stood face to face I know
I should have found delight in dragging him down
and choking the life out of him. A fierce desire to
fight him and punish him took possession of me;
and for an hour or two hunger, thirst, injustice,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
everything was forgotten in that all but insane craving
for revenge.</p>

<p>But rage cannot last for ever and when some
rough prison food&mdash;gruel, black bread, and a pannikin
of water&mdash;was thrust into my cell an hour or
two later, the sight of it re-roused my hunger and
blanketed my passion. So famished was I by that
time that I had to clamp down the desperate impulse
to cram it into my mouth with the unbridled
voracity of a starving beast.</p>

<p>It was excellent self-discipline to eat it slowly.
But I succeeded. I took it, just a mouthful at a
time, with long intervals between, thus spreading
out the meal over perhaps two hours or more. And
at the end of the time I was myself once more, had
regained my self-restraint, and was able to think.</p>

<p>What they meant to do with me, I could not see;
but what I would do was clear enough. I would
conform to every rule of the prison life and wait
for the chance of communicating with my friend or
with the British Consul. Let that bully break down
my resolve, I would not, if I had to stay in the
prison till I was grey. And when my time came,
I would have a reckoning with him, even if the
immediate result was only to bring me back to the
prison with a real crime for the reason.</p>

<p>On entering the gaol I had been searched, and my
watch and money, everything, indeed, taken from
me. I could not, therefore, try the bribery trick
again, even if the chance had offered. So I made
the best of a very bad job, arranged my torn clothes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
in such fashion as I could, rubbed the bruises where
the brutes had kicked or struck me, and got all the
sleep that was possible.</p>

<p>The attempt to starve me was abandoned, and
later in the day another meal, black bread and water
this time, was served. I was left to myself that
day and the whole of the next, except when the food
was brought, or when I was ordered roughly to
clean the cell, or when a warder in the corridor
would open the grill in the door and after grinning
at me would utter some vile epithet. They were a
genial pleasant set of men.</p>

<p>On the third day, however, a fresh course was
attempted. A man I had not seen before entered
my cell, and after very little preface hinted that if
I would pay him, he would carry some communication
to my friends. Suspicious that it was a trick,
I declined; and then he urged me to make a full
confession of all I knew and submit to the authorities.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you call this but submitting?&#8221; I retorted.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t see what other course is left to
me. But I have done nothing, and have no confession
to make therefore.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By submission I mean answer the questions of
Colonel Bremenhof.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that the man who interrogated me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Will you not confess to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no confession to make,&#8221; I cut in. &#8220;But
I&#8217;m glad to know his name. I shan&#8217;t forget it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He tried to work on my fears, then. This was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
not England, the times were troubled, military laws
prevailed, and suspects who would not account for
themselves might be treated very harshly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have had ample proof of that myself, thank
you,&#8221; said I, drily; &#8220;and as soon as I am free, I
shall see that some others learn to spell the word.&#8221;</p>

<p>He gave me up then and left with a curt warning.
&#8220;You will not be free until you have submitted.&#8221;</p>

<p>It began to look as though it was to be trial of
staying power; and I had all that day and half the
next to ponder his warning.</p>

<p>Then something happened.</p>

<p>I had had my midday meal and was trying to
sleep when I heard the shuffling of steps and the
murmur of voices in the corridor.</p>

<p>There was a pause, the key was thrust into the
lock, the door thrown open and two warders entered
followed by the bully and, of all people in the world,
the least expected&mdash;Volna.</p>

<small>I GET A BIT OF MY OWN BACK</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AT the sight of the man who had used his official
power to give me the lie and then have me
treated like a felon my rage flashed at once into a
flame.</p>

<p>But for that, my astonishment at seeing Volna
would have drawn some sign of recognition before
my instinctive caution could have prevented it. As
it was, however, my gaze fastened on Colonel
Bremenhof.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s you, is it?&#8221; I said, and I jumped up and
stepped toward him.</p>

<p>He retreated, and the two warders interposed
quickly and pushed me back. But the incident had
served a purpose. It prevented the bully&#8217;s noticing
Volna&#8217;s start of dismay on recognising me.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; I sneered. &#8220;Keep your bulldogs
about you. It&#8217;s not safe to come near me without
some one to take care of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>His anger and chagrin were intense. I knew
afterwards what he had hoped to gain by bringing
Volna to my cell; and the failure of the plan galled
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the fellow, Volna, who was found with
your uncle&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he began, when I broke in.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>&#8220;Have you communicated with my friend
General von Eckerstein?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Silence, prisoner,&#8221; he cried, angrily. &#8220;Now,
Volna, I want you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I a show for all Warsaw to see? I have
suffered your brutality&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Silence, I say. Disobedient scoundrels get the
lash here.&#8221;</p>

<p>I sneered and shrugged my shoulders. &#8220;You
miserable coward; a mere cur in office, barking only
when you think it safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>This had the infuriating effect I wished. He lost
control of himself, and, pushing the two warders
aside, he rushed forward with hand raised to strike
me.</p>

<p>I let him come quite close, and then hit him full
on his insolent mouth, putting all my weight and
strength behind the blow. He went down like a
ninepin, and so far as he was concerned, the interview
was over.</p>

<p>A pretty considerable row followed. The two
warders threw themselves on me and shouted lustily
for help. Others rushed to the cell in a ferment of
excitement and clustered between me and the bully,
much as though I were a wild beast. He was carried
off, and Volna, in a maze of distress and consternation,
was taken away at the same time.</p>

<p>I was now considered to be a desperate and dangerous
prisoner. Handcuffs were placed on my
wrists and irons on my legs, neither of the operations
being gently performed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>But I did not care. I had got back a little of my
own from the brute, and they might do what they
pleased with me now. What that would be, I was
soon to learn.</p>

<p>I was huddled up on my pallet in the exceedingly
uncomfortable position which the irons permitted
when the governor of the gaol and a couple of other
officials entered with some warders.</p>

<p>He read me a short lecture upon the heinousness
of my awful offence, told me that men had been
killed who had done less, and then announced that
my punishment would be the knout. Three hundred
lashes to be administered at intervals of a week, a
hundred lashes each time.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am an Englishman, and claim the right to
communicate with the British Consul, and also my
friend, General von Eckerstein.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t dare to deny that you struck Colonel
Bremenhof?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My quarrel is personal with him. He sent me
here in the first instance without any cause and
was going to strike me just now when I hit
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Enough,&#8221; was the stern reply. &#8220;You have
admitted your infamous act. The first portion of
your punishment will be administered to-morrow;&#8221;
and with that he turned on his heel and left me to
my own reflections.</p>

<p>They were gloomy enough. I had once seen a
man knouted, and had winced as the lash tore the
flesh from the poor devil&#8217;s back. I would rather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
have been sentenced to be shot at once; and for a
few mad moments I indulged in wild thoughts of
self-destruction or of attempting a fierce attack on
some one in the prison which would bring a capital
sentence.</p>

<p>Sanity returned presently, however, and after a
time the extraordinary circumstances of Volna&#8217;s
visit began to claim my thoughts.</p>

<p>What baffled me as much as anything was that
Colonel Bremenhof had addressed her by her
Christian name. What could he be to her, or she
to him? He had evidently brought her to the
prison to identify me; but what could be his motive?
Could she have fallen under suspicion? What did
he know, and how had he guessed that she and I
had been together? Had she been confronted with
the police agent of the Devil&#8217;s Staircase incident?
Was she to be charged? That did not seem possible
in view of the fact that she was apparently free and
he had spoken to her as to a friend.</p>

<p>I raked my wits over and over again in repeated
attempts to answer these questions, only to give up
the puzzle as hopeless.</p>

<p>No one came near me again all that afternoon
and evening, and as the hours passed, the thought
of what was in store for me on the morrow became
more and more oppressive. And when, at length, I
heard the warders going their night rounds, I am
free to confess I was very close to despair.</p>

<p>I dreaded the lash as fully as any poor devil who
was ever sentenced to it deservedly; and I found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
myself speculating, with a coward&#8217;s fear, upon the
gruesome ordeal.</p>

<p>I could not sleep for the shuddering horror of the
thing. In vain I told myself that men had gone
through it before, and that what they had endured,
I could probably endure. There was no consolation
in that. The one thought that did afford me a
gleam of grim comfort was that if I did get through
it and was ever free, Colonel Bremenhof should
taste something of the horrors he had caused me
to endure before I would call my account with him
square.</p>

<p>There was a great deal of the brute in me in those
lingering hours of despair.</p>

<p>I was still in this mood of self-torturing apprehension,
trying vainly to get to sleep and shake off
the horrors of it when my cell door was opened and
two warders entered. By the lantern which one
carried I saw two other figures in the gloom beyond,
and I jumped to the conclusion that the time for
my knouting had been put forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the prisoner.&#8221; I recognized the governor&#8217;s
voice.</p>

<p>The warder&#8217;s lantern flashed to my face, and out
of the gloom came a sonorous &#8220;Good God!&#8221; Then
some one rushed forward and took my hands. &#8220;My
dear boy, what in the name of heaven and earth
does all this mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was my old friend, General von Eckerstein;
and as I felt the grasp of his hands I closed my eyes
with a deep, deep sigh of intense thankfulness.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>&#8220;There has been a bad mistake, that&#8217;s all,&#8221; I
said, scarcely knowing what I said or did for the
moment. The sense of relief was so intense as to
be almost overpowering. I found myself laughing
fatuously.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is your friend, General?&#8221; asked the
governor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, of course it is. It&#8217;s the most extraordinary
thing in the world. Why on earth didn&#8217;t
you send for me before?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I tried to, but&mdash;I had better explain everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has proved himself a very dangerous and
desperate man, General,&#8221; said the governor. &#8220;Will
you answer for him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Answer for him? Yes; with my life, man.
Can you let me see him privately? I&#8217;m lost in
amazement.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take off his irons,&#8221; ordered the governor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fettered, too. Heavens! what would your
father have said?&#8221;</p>

<p>The irons were taken off and I was allowed to go
with the General to one of the governor&#8217;s rooms
where we were left alone. This gave me time to
regain my self-control.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now perhaps you&#8217;ll tell me all about it,&#8221; said
my friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two things first. Give me a cigar, and tell
me how you have come from Petersburg just in the
nick of time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From Petersburg? I have not come from
Petersburg; I am in Warsaw for a time. But what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
do you mean? You knew that when you sent me
this.&#8221;</p>

<p>He handed me a letter as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot2">
<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Dear old Friend</span>,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come to me at once to the Kreuzstadt fortress.
I am a prisoner. For God&#8217;s sake.</p>

<p class="right">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Robert Anstruther.</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot write this myself, but do not fail me.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>His shrewd eyes were fixed upon me as I looked
up. &#8220;Umph! Who&#8217;s the woman?&#8221; he asked. I
hesitated and smiled as I laid the letter down, and,
to fill the pause, lighted my cigar. &#8220;Don&#8217;t,&#8221; he
jerked. I started; for the warning came so pat on
my thoughts of the best tale to make.</p>

<p>I looked across and met his keen, penetrating
gaze.</p>

<p>&#8220;Young Bob Anstruther, if you try and lie to
me I&#8217;ll throw up the whole thing. Trust me with
the truth, and I&#8217;ll do for you what your father&#8217;s
friend should.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The secret is not mine and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Devil take the boy,&#8221; he burst in vehemently.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t I love John Anstruther&#8217;s son like my own
child, or do you think an old diplomat gabs and
blabs like a washerwoman? Confound you, do you
want to make me give you my word of honour, you
young idiot?&#8221;</p>

<p>I hesitated no longer, but told him the whole
story from the meeting with Volna at Bratinsk railway<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
station down to that moment, omitting only
the part which referred to Father Ambrose and the
Fraternity signals.</p>

<p>&#8220;The portion I don&#8217;t tell you doesn&#8217;t affect my
case, General; and I am under my pledged word
not to reveal it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve told me about enough,&#8221; he retorted
grimly; and for a while we sat and smoked and
looked at one another in silence.</p>

<p>Presently, with a short laugh, he took his cigar
from his lips. &#8220;You&#8217;re a hot-headed young fool,
Bob, just that and nothing more. But&#8221;&mdash;he
paused, brushed back his grey hair, sighed, and then
smiled&mdash;&#8220;I suppose at your age I should have done
pretty much the same, and I&#8217;m cock-sure your father
would.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take my gruelling, sir, if it comes to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk nonsense, boy. Do you think I&#8217;ll
let &#8217;em touch you? But we must move very warily.
Will you apologize to Colonel Bremenhof?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see him hanged first,&#8221; I cried.</p>

<p>He grinned and nodded. &#8220;You mean to make it
as stiff for me as you can. That&#8217;s always the way
with young folk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you have me apologize to him?&#8221;</p>

<p>His face stiffened and his eyelids came together
till they were mere slits through which his pupils
gleamed. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad you hit him; although that
blow is just the toughest nut to crack. But we
must get to work. Thank Heaven, he put himself
in the wrong as usual.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>He rang the bell and sent for the governor. His
manner became suddenly as stern as with me it had
been kind.</p>

<p>&#8220;There has been a very serious miscarriage of
justice here, Major Pruladoff. This is Mr. Robert
Anstruther, the son of a man who was the intimate
friend of half the Berlin Court and trusted by the
Emperor. His imprisonment is nothing short of an
outrage, and what makes it really serious is that his
demand, made as his right, to see the British Consul
and to communicate with me, was refused.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know nothing of that, of course, General.
He was brought here on the order of Colonel
Bremenhof.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oblige me by calling him up on the telephone,
and let me speak with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Some minutes passed before the governor announced
that the Colonel was waiting. My old
friend went to the instrument.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that Colonel Bremenhof? This is General
von Eckerstein. I wish to know why, when the
young Englishman, Robert Anstruther, was brought
before you, you refused to allow him to communicate
with the British Consul and with me, his
friend? What&#8217;s that? That does not answer my
question. By what right did you refuse? What&#8217;s
that? I can&#8217;t hear you. Oh, your mouth is swollen
and you can only speak with difficulty?&#8221;</p>

<p>This was for my benefit, I knew, and I would
have smiled if Major Pruladoff hadn&#8217;t been frowning
grimly at me.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>&#8220;You can give me a direct answer all the same,&#8221;
continued the General at the instrument. There
was a pause, filled by the insistent buzz of the voice
replying. &#8220;That is no reason. You know that,
sir. What? Well, you can&#8217;t treat Englishmen like
that. It will be my countryman&#8217;s turn next. But
you had his papers. Very well, then, I am going
now to the governor. Yes, of course I will, as for
my own countryman, as my own son, in fact. Nonsense.
What your men thought doesn&#8217;t touch the
point of your refusal. You know that. Well, if you
don&#8217;t think the thing had better be hushed up, there&#8217;s
an end of it. Mr. Anstruther will communicate
with the Consul here and wire to the Ambassador
at Petersburg. What do you mean? Do you dare
to try and make me a party to your illegal act?
Then you shouldn&#8217;t suggest it. Certainly. If you
don&#8217;t send down an order for his release I shall not
exert any further influence to restrain Mr. Anstruther
from using his unquestionable rights, and
shall myself wire to the Minister of the Interior. An
hour. No, sir, not five minutes. At once!&#8221; and
the General hung up the receiver.</p>

<p>The telephone bell rang furiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just write a short note to Mr. Hardy, the Consul,
Robert, and I&#8217;ll take it to him myself. He will
at once communicate with Petersburg and in the
meantime I&#8217;ll wire to the Minister. You&#8217;ll permit
the letter to be written, Major?&#8221;</p>

<p>The bell was going all the time.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am in a difficult position, General,&#8221; replied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
the governor. &#8220;That is probably Colonel Bremenhof.
Won&#8217;t you answer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly not. You&#8217;d better ask him if he persists
in his refusal; and you may add it doesn&#8217;t
matter, because I shall see Mr. Hardy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Colonel wishes to speak to you again,
General,&#8221; said the Major from the instrument.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no more time to waste over the telephone;&#8221;
and my friend put on his overcoat. &#8220;You
must go back to your cell, Robert; but Mr. Hardy
is a prompt man, and before morning we shall have
word of some kind from Petersburg. Good-night,
boy;&#8221; and as he shook my hand he winked.</p>

<p>&#8220;General von Eckerstein is going, Colonel,&#8221; said
the governor through the telephone. &#8220;The Colonel
wishes to know where you are going, General.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell him to mind to his own business and I&#8217;ll
mind mine,&#8221; was the angry reply, and it was repeated
over the wire.</p>

<p>The General walked to the door and opened it.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Colonel urgently begs you to speak with
him, General.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I to wait for that letter to be written or
not, sir?&#8221; His face might have been a stone mask
in its sternness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please wait a moment, General. As a personal
favour to me. I really don&#8217;t know what to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no more time to waste, I say. I demand
a reply now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Anstruther, will you ask the General? It
may be of the highest moment to you.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>A very different sort of governor this from the
one who had lectured me so sternly in my cell, and
then glibly sentenced me to the knout.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I have been treated too infamously. I
prefer to put the matter in the hands of the British
authorities,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;All Europe shall know
how foreigners are treated in Warsaw.&#8221;</p>

<p>A glance from the General approved my reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can write to your Consul, then.&#8221; We both
understood that this was merely intended to gain
delay, and we wasted some time in pretended difficulty
about phrasing the letter, while a conversation
continued over the wire which clearly showed the
man at the other end was in trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s enough, Bob,&#8221; said the General presently.
&#8220;You can tell him all when he comes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank Heaven,&#8221; breathed the governor with a
sigh of relief as the receiver was hung up again.
&#8220;One moment, General. The Colonel is sending
an order for Mr. Anstruther&#8217;s release upon your
giving me your assurance to be responsible for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just in time,&#8221; exclaimed my old friend, curtly
and ungraciously, as he tore up the paper, on which,
by-the-bye, I had not written a line. &#8220;And about
that infernal knouting?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The affair is now out of my hands;&#8221; and the
governor gave another sigh of relief.</p>

<p>Half an hour later the order arrived, and we left
the prison together.</p>

<small>&#8220;DO YOU LOVE VOLNA DRAKONA?&#8221;</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE next day I did nothing except fit myself
out with some new clothes, and speculate about
my future course.</p>

<p>I could not decide anything until I saw the
General; and before I rose he had gone out and had
left word for me to wait in the house for him.</p>

<p>After the harrassing uncertainty of my spell in
prison, the scene with Bremenhof on the previous
day, and the disturbing ordeal of the crisis it had
produced, the mere rest and sense of security were
indescribably welcome.</p>

<p>I had plenty to think about, of course, but it was
more like floundering speculation than consecutive
thought. How Volna had returned to Warsaw?
What was behind her visit to the prison? What
the connection was between her and Colonel Bremenhof?
What his motive could be in bringing her
to the prison? Whether she had fallen under suspicion?
How was I to set about ascertaining the
truth? How to find means of seeing her again?
With no facts to guide me, I could not answer the
puzzling questions which suggested themselves thus
readily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have settled your matter,&#8221; said the General
when we were closeted together in the evening.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
&#8220;Here are your papers, passport, and letter of
credit; and I have succeeded in making Colonel
Bremenhof understand that the affair with him had
better be regarded as a personal quarrel. I have
pledged my word for you&mdash;that you are no more a
revolutionary than I am; that in anything you may
have done, you were just a tool in others&#8217; hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s rather rough on the &#8216;others,&#8217;&#8221; I protested.</p>

<p>&#8220;There will be an opportunity given to you, the
day after to-morrow, to say all you know about the
partner of your flight from Bratinsk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be devilish awkward,&#8221; I murmured.</p>

<p>&#8220;Better than three hundred lashes, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; he
returned drily. &#8220;But you don&#8217;t see the point. The
day after to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One day is just as awkward as another.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not as sharp as your father, Bob.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sons never are,&#8221; I agreed, with a grin.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;d have known what to do with a day and
a half&#8217;s grace, and a passport put back in his hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! You mean I should bolt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going to make an egregious young ass
of yourself again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks like it to you, no doubt,&#8221; I said, a little
sheepishly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Umph. There&#8217;s a train west at midnight.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a long pause. &#8220;Do you think my
father would have bolted?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>He pursed his lips and frowned. &#8220;Is she so much
to you?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>&#8220;She is the one woman in the world to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He appeared to expect the answer and yet to
regret it. &#8220;Then, of course, you&#8217;ll stay. You see
what it means?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care what it means.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got you out of this mess, but if you give
Bremenhof another chance against you, you&#8217;ll have
to shift for yourself. I shall be powerless to help
you. I can&#8217;t tell you official secrets, but I may warn
you that we are face to face with events the results
of which no man can foresee. It may spell revolution
and bloodshed; and to be even a suspect then
will be full of hazard and peril.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The more reason for me to stop.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bremenhof has already great power, and if a
crisis comes, he will have a free hand. He hates
you,&mdash;not only for what you have done to him, but
for another reason. Volna Drakona is betrothed
to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To that brutal bully? I can&#8217;t believe it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know what I say. If he gets half a chance at
you, you&#8217;ll feel his hand. Take my advice and go.&#8221;
He was very earnest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not for fifty infernal Bremenhofs,&#8221; I cried
passionately.</p>

<p>He flung the end of his cigar away and rose.
&#8220;That&#8217;s your last word? It may prove a serious
mistake for the girl&#8217;s sake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My last word&mdash;absolutely.&#8221;</p>

<p>A half-quizzical smile relieved the earnestness of
his look for a moment. &#8220;I believe you&#8217;ll make an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
awful mess of things, Bob; but it&#8217;s glorious to be
young. If I can help you, I will; but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; a shrug
of the shoulders and a toss of the hands finished
the sentence, as he turned away to his desk.</p>

<p>I bade him good-night a few minutes later and
thanked him again for his help.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sleep over it all; perhaps it will look different
in the morning and you may be able to see how your
staying can help the girl. I can&#8217;t.&#8221; Then with
the same kindly, half-quizzical smile he added: &#8220;But
then I&#8217;m only a thin-blooded old cynic and you&#8217;re
a pulseful young fellow in love. A tremendous
difference, Bob. Eh? Tremendous.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sleep over it I did not, at least for some hours;
but worry over it I did certainly, tossing and turning
restlessly until near the dawn; striving to understand
this new complication of Volna&#8217;s betrothal to
Bremenhof.</p>

<p>If he knew or suspected that I had helped her at
Bratinsk, I could understand his treatment of me.
A beast by nature and a bully by official opportunity,
if his jealousy had been roused it was quite likely
to render him the brute he had shewn himself to me.
It would explain his having brought her to my
cell. He had probably wished to confirm or dissipate
his suspicion that Volna had been my companion
in the flight. Yet he could have done that
in a moment by confronting her with either of the
police agents. Why had he not done that?</p>

<p>Puzzling over this question I stumbled on what
might possibly be the key. He might wish for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
private reasons to convince himself and yet be unwilling
to do this officially. If the police agents
recognised her, he might be unable to shield her
from the consequences of her act.</p>

<p>This gave me another idea. If he was afraid to
have Volna publicly and officially identified, I saw
how to bluff him. I could demand to have my
examination a strictly official one; and so outplay
him.</p>

<p>His object was now to frighten me away from
Warsaw by threatening to have me examined as to
my part; but if I could convince him that I meant
that examination to end in the public identification
of Volna, he would be as loath to hold it as I was
to face it.</p>

<p>But I must first satisfy myself of the facts behind
this betrothal. I recalled her reference to an
entanglement; but I laughed at the notion that she
cared for him. Yet how could I get at the truth?</p>

<p>This question was still unsettled when I rose the
next morning; and then Fortune did me a good
turn and put the answer in my reach.</p>

<p>The General looked a little troubled when he met
me. &#8220;I have had a telephone message about you,
Bob. From Count Ladislas Tuleski.&#8221;</p>

<p>I beamed. He was the very man to tell me all I
wished to know. &#8220;He&#8217;s one of my best friends,
General. He saved my life a couple of years ago
in the Alps at the risk of his own. It&#8217;s a stroke of
luck if he&#8217;s in the city.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are two kinds of luck, so that may be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
true. He had heard you were here and wants to
see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not half so badly as I want to see him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know he is one of the Fraternity leaders?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s the gentlest soul in the world and wouldn&#8217;t
hurt a fly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you go to his house under the circumstances,
it will be looked upon as suspicious; to-day of all
days in the year. I warn you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why to-day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I forgot you had been in prison for nearly a
week and don&#8217;t know the news. Every eye in
Russia to-day is waiting on events in Petersburg.
The strikers are going to the Winter Palace to
petition the Czar, and if bloodshed follows, as seems
inevitable, it may spread over the whole Empire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What has that to do with my seeing my
friend?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are playing with words, boy,&#8221; he answered
sternly. &#8220;He is a leader of this movement;
you are half suspect now; and if the trouble we
fear comes, you will give Bremenhof the chance he
seeks against you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not afraid of Colonel Bremenhof. I have
some questions to ask Ladislas that cannot
wait.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can only warn you, of course, but if you were
my son, I declare to God I&#8217;d put you under lock
and key to stop this madness,&#8221; he burst out almost
fiercely.</p>

<p>His vehemence seemed to me quite unwarranted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
and all out of perspective. &#8220;I shall come to no
harm, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t see what you are doing, boy. It is
madness&mdash;nothing short of it. Remember my warning
when the trouble comes, as it certainly will,&#8221;
and he turned away.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry to anger you, sir; but I fear I haven&#8217;t
made you understand all that this means to me. I
value your friendship and, believe me, I would take
your advice now if I could. But all I care about in
the world is concerned in this, and I must find out
the truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned, paused, appeared to hesitate, and then
shook his head. &#8220;No, I will be no party to foolishness
of this kind. I must not. You are taking a
risk you don&#8217;t or won&#8217;t understand;&#8221; and he left
me.</p>

<p>I knew that real solicitude for me was at the
bottom of my old friend&#8217;s anger and I was genuinely
sorry for the misunderstanding which had
arisen; but I could not listen to his counsel. Find
out the truth about Volna&#8217;s betrothal I must and
would; and short of going to Volna herself for it&mdash;an
obviously impossible course&mdash;to see Ladislas was
the only thing to do.</p>

<p>As I hastened to his house I perceived one thing,
however. I could no longer remain under the General&#8217;s
roof. That might compromise him: and I
resolved to write him from Ladislas&#8217; house that I
should not return.</p>

<p>I found my friend in a condition of excitement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
unusual even with him. He was always impulsive
and a slave to the mood of the moment, and I had
long ceased to be surprised by his neurotic impetuosity
and feverish unrest. It was this very self-regardless
impetuosity, indeed, which had led him
to offer his life for mine when he had dashed to my
rescue in the mountaineering incident which had
bound us together in bonds of close and affectionate
friendship.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had no idea you were in Warsaw, Ladislas,&#8221;
I said, as I gripped his hand, &#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you how
glad I am to see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He held my hand and wheeled me round to the
light as he stared into my eyes. &#8220;Let me look at
you. Do you come as a friend?&#8221;</p>

<p>I should have smiled, but for his careworn,
harrassed, eager expression as he put the strange
question. &#8220;I hope I shall never come to you as
anything but a friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>His black eyes shone for the second he continued
to stare at me. Then he dropped my hand, and
exclaimed. &#8220;My God, I hope so. My God, I hope
so; but there are things which turn even friends
into enemies;&#8221; and he sighed as he thrust his
fingers through his hair&mdash;he had the head of a poet
or musician and wore his fair hair quite long&mdash;and
began to pace up and down the room. It was
difficult for him to keep still at any time; and in
moments of unusual excitement he was as volatile
as quicksilver.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will have to be something serious to turn us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
into enemies, Ladislas,&#8221; I replied. &#8220;But tell me
what it is you think might do it. I shan&#8217;t shirk
a test, I promise you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, you know there is something, then, Robert,&#8221;
he cried, wheeling round abruptly and with quite a
suggestion of fierceness. He was the only intimate
I had who refused to call me Bob. He considered
it undignified, he had once said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I only know that you sent for me, my dear
fellow, and I can see for myself that you are upset.
Tell me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He started on his walk again and in the pause I
lighted a cigar. Five or six times he crossed and
recrossed the room, his hands in his hair, in his
pockets, and tugging at the lapels of his coat in
turn. Then he came and stood over me and fixed
his great eyes on mine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you love Volna Drakona? Answer me;
on your solemn word of honour, for the love of
God.&#8221;</p>

<small>FOR FRIENDSHIP&#8217;S SAKE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MY friend&#8217;s question came like a clap of thunder
in the clear blue of a summer sky, so absolutely
startling was its surprise.</p>

<p>In the second&#8217;s pause before I replied, many of
the complicating possibilities involved in it flashed
upon me as his burning almost passionate gaze was
bent upon me.</p>

<p>I pushed my chair back, rose and gripped his
hand. &#8220;We must talk this over, Ladislas, as
friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Answer me. Answer me,&#8221; he cried, trying to
release his hand. &#8220;I must know, before we talk of
friendship.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will answer you. I give you my honour you
shall have nothing but the truth from me; but I
must first know all that lies behind the question
and all that depends upon it. Come, man, speak out.
Don&#8217;t try to drag your hand away. We are men
as well as dear friends; and whatever has to be
said or done, must not and shall not break our
friendship.&#8221; I placed my other hand on his shoulder.
&#8220;Can&#8217;t you agree to this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not if you have come between me and her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are unbalanced in your excitement, or you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
would never say that to me. Understand what I
say. Nothing&mdash;mark, nothing shall ever make me
other than your friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>I felt him trembling under my hand; and again
he tried to free himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Ladislas; I do not let you go until you
agree in that. You saved my life once. Do you
think I forget? I told you then that if the day
ever came for me to pay the debt, I should be glad.
Now, what is this girl to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;More than my life. My God, much more.
More than even my honour, I believe, God help me.&#8221;</p>

<p>I steadied myself and spoke firmly. &#8220;What is it
you ask of me?&#8221;</p>

<p>His large expressive eyes lighted with eagerness.
&#8220;Can you do this for me? Can you give her to
me?&#8221;</p>

<p>I clenched my hands until the nails dug into the
palms with the intensity of my effort for composure.
It was the crisis of my life.</p>

<p>&#8220;My God, you cannot? You will not? And
you pledged your oath. I saved your life; and you
are false to your word.&#8221; He said this rapidly,
vehemently, fiercely. Then with a sudden change
he flung himself into a chair and covered his face
with his hands, crying: &#8220;God, God, what a coward
I am!&#8221;</p>

<p>I resumed my seat and as I faced the sacrifice
that was now demanded of me, the old scene flashed
vividly into my thoughts.</p>

<p>On a treacherous slope of crumbling rubble not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
thirty feet from the edge of an Alpine abyss, dropping
a thousand feet sheer to the rocks below, a
young fellow lay on his back, sweat-stained and
staring, heels and hands dug desperately into the
yielding surface as he measured the inches and reckoned
the moments between him and the death yawning
just below him. Slip, slip, slip, an inch or two
at a time, he slid. Clutch as he would with his
bleeding fingers and strain as he did, he could not
prevent himself from being carried down, down,
down with slow but heart-sickening certainty.</p>

<p>Death seemed inevitable; and as it is better to
die quickly than to linger with nerve-racking hopelessness,
he had made up his mind to let himself
go and get it over, when a cheery call came from
above, and the light of hope was kindled once again
in his beating heart.</p>

<p>At the hazard of his life another man launched
himself on that death slide and, with a courage
equalled only by his mountaineering skill, carried
a rope to his friend and saved his life just as his
feet reached the very brink of the abyss.</p>

<p>I was the clumsy fool who had stupidly jeopardized
my life and Ladislas the friend who offered
his to save me.</p>

<p>And now Volna was to be the price! He had
called for it: had thrown in my teeth the pledge I
had given; and had chided me for my unreadiness
to redeem it. This the friend whom I had always
deemed the type of honour and chivalry! Bargaining
for the body of the woman he loved!</p>

<p>In the first bitter moment my soul rose in passionate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
rebellion against the sacrifice. Nothing in all
my life had ever moved me so deeply. To make
myself a party to the bargain was to do dishonour to
Volna herself. What right had we to take this
thing into our hands and settle her life for her? It
was for her, not for us, to make a decision so vital
to her happiness.</p>

<p>Such a price as this had never been in contemplation.
He knew this as well as I. And at that
point my memory played me a curious trick. My
thoughts flashed back to the moment of cold despair
when death lay gaping just below me on that mountain
slide; to the dazzling change to hope at the
sound of Ladislas&#8217; cheery call of encouragement.
I saw him again working his way toward me, death
the certain penalty of a single unskilful step; and
once again the warm glow of gratitude for the
dauntless courage and devotion which had prompted
my pledge then, came back in all its force now.</p>

<p>It ended the struggle. I would pay the price,
let the cost be what it might.</p>

<p>I sighed heavily and turned to find him leaning
forward watching me intently and waiting, as
though he divined the struggle that was rending me.</p>

<p>I smiled. &#8220;I won&#8217;t pretend that it hasn&#8217;t cost
me a struggle, Ladislas; but it&#8217;s over: and we can
still be friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How strong you are!&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t think there was much strength
in me if you knew the bitter things I was thinking
just now of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You love her, then?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>&#8220;I can&#8217;t help that&mdash;but I can trust myself for
the rest. Would to Heaven I had known before
this had happened at Bratinsk! So little did I
suspect, I came to-day to ask you the meaning of
her betrothal to Colonel Bremenhof.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is an awful mess!&#8221; he exclaimed, and began
pacing the room again. &#8220;Count Peter arranged
that. It was a blind to keep the Drakonas from
being suspected. Volna consented for her mother&#8217;s
sake; but she was candid, telling the man she did
not care for him. She is as true as a crystal. Her
sister and brother&mdash;do you know them? No?&mdash;they
fed him with lies and blinded him; all at the
Count&#8217;s instigation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bremenhof is a devil for cunning. He was not
deceived; and he saw at once that his hold over
Volna was her fear for her mother. So he wormed
and moled and got a case against the mother; and
now he swears that if the marriage does not take
place at once&mdash;to-day or at latest to-morrow&mdash;he
will have the mother arrested, and Volna, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know of my affair with him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Volna told me you struck him. He took
her there to satisfy himself privately that she had
been at Bratinsk; and have that to hold over her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why have you let her stay at Warsaw?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Count Peter was bringing her to Cracow to be
married to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Married to you! I don&#8217;t understand. Were
you secretly betrothed?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>&#8220;No, no. She had no thought of it, until Count
Peter told her at Bratinsk. But she knows how
I love her; and we should have won her to
consent.&#8221;</p>

<p>I remembered her statement to me at Bratinsk;
that she had meant to escape and return to Warsaw.
But I kept this to myself.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is changed. It is you who have changed
her. She can scarcely be kept from breaking with
Bremenhof. I don&#8217;t know what to do. My God, I
don&#8217;t know what to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s plain enough. Take her and her mother
away from Warsaw.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can I go, man? In Heaven&#8217;s name, how
can I go? We are on the eve of the most glorious
crisis in our country&#8217;s history; and we leaders dare
not leave our posts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Send them away then in some one else&#8217;s care.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why? This city is the safest place in all the
Empire for them. To-day the great demonstration
at Petersburg will show the Czar and those about
him and all the world that the people&#8217;s just demands
can no longer be resisted. The power of these
tyrants will be shattered against the greater might
of the people&#8217;s will. You know my dreams of old.
They are coming true. We are on the eve of the
greatest revolution the world has ever seen: greatest
in purpose, widest in area, most beneficial in results&mdash;and
what is greatest of all&mdash;to be achieved without
the shedding of a drop of blood.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>&#8220;A bloodless revolution will be a new thing in
history, Ladislas, especially under Russian methods.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You do not understand and so you doubt. But
we know. The army is with us almost to a man.
They are of the people, blood of blood and bone
of bone in close-knit kinship; and when the hour
strikes, the people will rise in every city, town, and
hamlet, rise as one man; and at that rising the
musket of every soldier will be grounded and not
a sword will leave its scabbard. Peace is our watch-word;
peace our method; peace and brotherhood
our end.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not only Polish independence then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poland will be free. Poland will lift her head
again, a nation among the nations: but all Russia
will be free in the gigantic upheaval.&#8221;</p>

<p>His eyes gleamed with excitement as he strode
up and down flinging his arms about; his enthusiasm
fired by his own rhapsody. He was very much
the dreamer; and he gave the reins to his dream
with voluble energy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you any practical men among you?&#8221; I
asked, when at length he paused.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are all practical. My dear friend, you do
not know us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True; but suppose you are wrong and that in
some places the troops stand by the Government,
what will you do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Should we legislate for the impossible?&#8221; and
he went on with a hundred and fifty unconvincing
and inconsequent reasons why nothing of the kind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
could occur. &#8220;We are offering liberty&mdash;liberty, the
grandest gift on God&#8217;s green earth&mdash;not only to the
people, but to the soldiers themselves. They are
not fools, or blind, or idiots to refuse it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But your troops here are not Poles, but Russians
hating the Poles; and the disposition of the regiments
all over the Empire is on the same principle.
Do you tell me that national and tribal hatreds are
going to be smothered just because a few good fellows
like you hold up your hands and cry &#8216;Liberty&#8217;?
To put it in a nutshell, if you believe this, why are
you afraid of what Bremenhof can do in regard to
Volna?&#8221;</p>

<p>To my surprise and concern he collapsed entirely.
He threw himself into a chair and pressed his hand
to his face. &#8220;Don&#8217;t, don&#8217;t,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;You give
life and form to the one deadly fear that chills me
when I can&#8217;t suppress it; that haunts me at night
like a spectre, and paralyzes me with the agony
of its hideous possibilities. I dare not think of
it, my friend; I dare not. God, God, I dare
not.&#8221;</p>

<p>I said no more. He was curious material for
revolutionary work; but if there were many like
him, the Fraternity was a much less formidable
body than I had deemed, despite the evidence I had
had of its widespread organization.</p>

<p>Presently he roused himself, stood up and apparently
with only the slightest effort shook off his
depression.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean to inflict this on you,&#8221; he said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
with a smile, charming but almost pathetically
weary.</p>

<p>My patience was nearly exhausted, however.
&#8220;What are you going to do to save her?&#8221; I asked
bluntly.</p>

<p>He shook back his long hair, and smiled. &#8220;To-morrow
there will be no more thought or talk of
danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then he was called out, and when he returned
a few minutes later, his face was grey and drawn
and haggard with anxiety.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must take her away from Warsaw,&#8221; he
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I? Ladislas! What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>He held up a paper in his trembling hand.
&#8220;News from Petersburg. The soldiers are drawn
up in thousands all over the city there. Guns are
posted in all directions; God knows what is going to
happen. If there is bloodshed there, hell will break
loose here. You alone can save her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Ladislas, you forget. For me to do anything
now&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He caught both my hands in his agitation.
&#8220;You&#8217;ll do this, Robert? For our old friendship&#8217;s
sake? For her sake? If she stays here, God alone
knows what may happen. You must do it. You
must. You must.&#8221; He was almost hysterical.</p>

<p>&#8220;But after what I have told you about her and
you have implied to me, my position&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is all that compared to her safety? Do
you think I would not trust you? Come to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
house with me at once&mdash;this instant. Would you
leave her in Bremenhof&#8217;s power?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, I cannot go with you. You ask too
much. For her sake, no less than mine, you must
find some other means,&#8221; I protested.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no other way,&#8221; he cried, impetuously
and vehemently. &#8220;She shall know the truth. I
will tell her that you renounce&mdash;that&mdash;you know
what I mean. For God&#8217;s sake, don&#8217;t hesitate or
it may be too late. At any cost she must be saved;
and her family can do nothing. She shall know that
you are acting for me. I will explain everything.
It is no time for mere scruples or personal feeling.
If I trust you, surely you can trust yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was dead set against the plan: every impulse
and instinct protesting, except the desire to help
Volna. But that she would be in grievous danger,
should there be a rising in the city, was a fact nothing
could explain away; and that Ladislas was about
the last man in the world to be able to save her in
such a crisis appeared no less certain. If anything
was to be done, some one capable of taking a practical
view of things must do it; and her friends
appeared to be a set of most unpractical theorists.</p>

<p>But if I was to do anything, it must be made
absolutely plain to Volna that I was acting for
Ladislas&mdash;to save her for him. Surely a most awkward
situation to explain. But he continued to
urge me and declared he would leave no doubt in
her mind; and at length I yielded, and we started
for the Drakonas&#8217; house.</p>

<small>TURNING THE SCREW</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">EMBARRASSING as my position must have
been in any case, it was made much worse
by the manner of my reception at the Drakonas&#8217;.</p>

<p>Volna&#8217;s half-sister, Katinka, received us; and
the moment my name was mentioned, she left me
no room to doubt that so far as she was concerned
I was a most unwelcome visitor.</p>

<p>She was a complete contrast in appearance to
Volna. A slight, wiry, straight-backed, acid-faced,
little woman of about thirty, with a pair of lustrous
dark eyes so disproportionately large that the rest
of the features, except her thin straight lips, seemed
to pass unnoticed. She gave me a very frigid bow.
&#8220;We have of course heard of you from Volna, Mr.
Anstruther,&#8221; she said; her tone implying that what
she had heard was by no means to my credit; and
before I could reply, she turned to Ladislas. &#8220;Has
anything happened that you are here?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was plain to see that he was not at ease with
her. &#8220;Where is Volna?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is out. You have not brought Mr. Anstruther
to see her?&#8221; That he would be mad to
think of such a thing was her meaning.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have decided that she cannot safely remain
in the city.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>&#8220;Indeed. Why? Or perhaps I should ask this
gentleman. You had no such thought when I saw
you last.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have had grave news from Petersburg this
morning, Katinka.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, are you going to run away?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then how can Volna go?&#8221; She was a past
master in the art of insinuation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have induced my friend here to consent to
take her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her large eyes opened as if in profound astonishment
as she looked first at him and then turned
them slowly upon me, and coughed most suggestively.
&#8220;<i>You</i> have done this?&#8221; Had she put
the thought in blunt words she could not have
expressed more plainly her conviction that I had
concocted the plan for my own ends and that Ladislas
must be blind and mad to consent to it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I have; Mr. Anstruther understands precisely
the relationship that exists between Volna
and me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean which should but does not exist
between you,&#8221; she corrected, significantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anstruther is my loyal friend, Katinka.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have I expressed any doubt on that point?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Drakona is prejudiced against the English,
Robert,&#8221; said Ladislas, turning to me. He
flushed with vexation and appeared anxious to
apologize for my reception.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is surely my country&#8217;s misfortune,&#8221; said I.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>&#8220;That is insincere; but being English you of
course cannot help it,&#8221; was the reply, very unpleasantly
spoken.</p>

<p>Ladislas very foolishly took this up. &#8220;Anstruther
is my friend, Katinka,&#8221; he said warmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see that that affects the sincerity or
insincerity of what he says. Mr. Anstruther may
as well know that he has caused a great deal of
trouble in our family, and that so far as my brother
and myself are concerned, we do not thank him
for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My remark just now was merely intended as
one of common politeness, madam,&#8221; I said. &#8220;I
am not glad when I find any one prejudiced against
my countrymen. And I am quite sincere in expressing
regret if I have caused trouble to any of your
family.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her large eyes were fixed coldly upon me while I
spoke and at the end she paused and said&mdash;&#8220;Indeed!&#8221;
with a most disconcerting effect.</p>

<p>An awkward pause followed, broken by the
entrance of the brother, to whom she introduced me
in these terms. &#8220;This is Mr. Anstruther, Paul, who
has come with Ladislas to induce Volna to run
away from Warsaw at a moment when the flight
of any one from this house would be a disgrace to
the cause of the Fraternity.&#8221;</p>

<p>As might be expected, the introduction did not
please him. &#8220;I am not aware that we need the
interference of any outsiders, sir.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>&#8220;That is the word&mdash;interference,&#8221; agreed the
sister.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is nothing of the sort, Katinka,&#8221; declared
Ladislas, brusquely. &#8220;I have brought my friend,
Paul, to help in getting your mother and Volna
into some place of safety until the troubles here are
over. He knows all about the Bremenhof entanglement
and all about&mdash;er&mdash;Volna and myself. He
acts entirely at my suggestion and on my behalf
as my friend in this matter. You know that if any
violence breaks out, the city will be no safe place
for Volna or her mother&mdash;or any woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not going to run away,&#8221; said Katinka,
with placid malice. &#8220;But of course Volna will jump
at such a chance. Until this last deplorable affair,
she was accustomed to listen to <i>our</i> advice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see no necessity for it, Ladislas,&#8221; was Paul&#8217;s
verdict.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are of <i>no</i> account, Paul. It is not what <i>we</i>
think, of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is your mother?&#8221; asked Ladislas.</p>

<p>The question was answered by the entrance of
one of the sweetest old ladies I have ever seen. Just
Volna, thirty-five or forty years older; but Volna
without the spirit and capacity and plucky resource
I had seen her shew.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are Mr. Anstruther, I am sure,&#8221; she said,
as she gave me her hand with a sweet gracious
smile. &#8220;I know you by my Volna&#8217;s description;
and thank you from my heart for all you did.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>The brother and sister exchanged looks and
shrugs.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did no more, madame, than any one would
have done in a similar case.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You saved my dearest child, sir; and a mother&#8217;s
heart knows how to be grateful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He wishes to do more now, Madame Drakona;
and take you and Volna away from the city until
these troubles have blown over,&#8221; said Ladislas.</p>

<p>An expression of perplexity clouded her face and
she glanced doubtfully and nervously toward the
other two. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think I understand,&#8221; she said,
weakly. &#8220;I should like to go, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she stopped,
and it struck me she was looking for Katinka&#8217;s
sanction.</p>

<p>&#8220;These things are to be settled without regard to
what we Drakonas think,&#8221; said Katinka. &#8220;Of
course I regard it as indecorous, impracticable, unnecessary
and cowardly. But my opinion is not
even asked;&#8221; and she folded her hands and tapped
her foot and assumed the air of an injured martyr.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not my suggestion, madame, but that
of my friend, Ladislas here,&#8221; I said to the old
lady.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure I don&#8217;t know what to do. I wish
Volna were here. Could we go?&#8221; she replied; and
then a long and at times bitter discussion followed
in which I took no part. The dear old soul was
swayed first one way by Ladislas and then another
by Katinka. Paul&#8217;s part was chiefly that of echo
to his sister, who, I noticed, first settled things for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
herself and then put the responsibility upon him;
and held up his opinion as final and decisive.</p>

<p>How long the discussion would have lasted and
how many bitter insinuations Katinka would have
thrown out about me it is impossible to say; but
the end came in a fashion that was both dramatic
and startling.</p>

<p>Paul was called away to the telephone and when
he returned to the room he was ashen pale and
intensely agitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;There has been a massacre at Petersburg. The
troops have fired on the people and thousands have
been killed.&#8221;</p>

<p>A dead silence fell on us all, broken only by a
groan of anguish from Ladislas. We looked at one
another in silent horror as the realization of what
it might mean to all in Warsaw began to force itself
upon us.</p>

<p>Even Katinka was awe-stricken and aghast.</p>

<p>We were still under the spell of this strained
silence when a maid servant scared and white of
face rushed in.</p>

<p>&#8220;The police are here, madame, and ask for you,&#8221;
she cried.</p>

<p>An officer followed the girl, and out in the hallway
I saw a file of men drawn up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Madame Drakona?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am Madame Drakona. What do you want
with me?&#8221; asked the old lady, rising.</p>

<p>I noticed that Paul instead of stepping forward
to the mother&#8217;s side remained by his sister.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>&#8220;I have to ask you to accompany me to the
offices of the Department, madame,&#8221; said the
agent.</p>

<p>&#8220;To ask me? I don&#8217;t understand,&#8221; she replied
feebly. &#8220;Katinka, Paul, what can this mean?
When do you wish me to go, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My instructions are that you accompany me
immediately.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But there must be a mistake. I am sure there
must be. I cannot go until I have seen my daughter.
She is out. Can I not wait until she returns?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure there is no mistake?&#8221; asked Paul;
as Katinka crossed to Madame Drakona.</p>

<p>&#8220;My instructions are too precise to admit of
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By whose instructions do you act?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot answer that,&#8221; was the reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean that any charge is preferred
against this lady?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have only to do my duty, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>I turned to Paul. &#8220;Could you not telephone to
Colonel Bremenhof?&#8221;</p>

<p>Katinka took this to herself. &#8220;You hear your
orders, Paul,&#8221; she snapped. Even in that moment
her spite predominated.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not need your advice, sir,&#8221; he said; and
this perfectly obvious step was not taken, for no
reason apparently except that I had suggested it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can I wait for my daughter to return, sir?&#8221;
asked Madame Drakona.</p>

<p>&#8220;Volna can do nothing,&#8221; declared Katinka.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>&#8220;I regret, madame, that I have no power to
permit that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you tell us nothing about the reasons for
this?&#8221; asked Paul.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing whatever. I know no more than yourself.
I wish indeed that the unpleasant duty had
been given to some one else to perform.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not blame you, sir,&#8221; said Madame Drakona,
very graciously, despite her agitation. &#8220;I will get
ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must ask you not to be longer than five
minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>He held the door open for her to leave. Katinka
went with her and at a sign from the leader, one of
the men followed them up the stairs and remained
at the door of the room into which they went. The
leader stayed with the rest in the hall.</p>

<p>&#8220;What can this mean?&#8221; asked Ladislas, aghast.</p>

<p>&#8220;A good thing that no one else is on the list,&#8221;
said Paul.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must find that a great consolation,&#8221; I could
not help saying. Paul turned on me angrily, and
Ladislas held up his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will do no good to quarrel,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What
is to be done? Do let us try to be practical.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The man who can tell you what it means is
Bremenhof.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you will go with your mother,
Paul?&#8221; said Ladislas.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see no object to be gained.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Better ask Miss Drakona,&#8221; I suggested, drily.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>&#8220;Your tone is very singular, sir,&#8221; declared Paul
angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Far less singular than your unreasoning hostility
to me, in which you appear to echo your
sister&#8217;s prejudice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Robert!&#8221; protested Ladislas.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not here by our wish,&#8221; cried Paul.</p>

<p>Madame Drakona came in then, and I saw that
Katinka had made no preparations to go with the
mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ladislas, you and Mr. Anstruther will stay to
see Volna, won&#8217;t you?&#8221; asked the old lady, who
was much less distressed than I had anticipated.
&#8220;She will be so troubled; and she thinks so much
of your advice, Mr. Anstruther. You will stay?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly at your wish,&#8221; I agreed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see that this gentleman can do any
good,&#8221; murmured the sister.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will both stay, if possible&mdash;but one of us
certainly,&#8221; said Ladislas.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell her you don&#8217;t think this is a serious thing;
it can&#8217;t be really; and I daresay I shall be back
again almost before she is home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will tell her,&#8221; replied my friend.</p>

<p>She kissed Paul and Katinka&mdash;both of whom
were as unmoved as though she had been going for
an afternoon drive&mdash;and then shook hands with
us. &#8220;Volna will rely on you, I know, Mr. Anstruther.
Now, sir, I am ready. Be sure and make
Volna understand I am not in the least frightened,
Ladislas.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>That was her last word spoken with a brave smile
as she drove away.</p>

<p>As soon as we re-entered the house Katinka
opened fire at me. &#8220;I think we can do what has to
be done alone, Paul.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Madame Drakona asked us to remain, Katinka,&#8221;
said Ladislas.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you could believe, madam, that I have
no desire except for the good of you all,&#8221; I put in.</p>

<p>She fixed her eyes upon me and replied slowly,
&#8220;I wish I could, sir; but you have influenced my
sister so much against us that I find it impossible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can you think of such pettiness, Katinka,
in face of that awful news from Petersburg,&#8221; cried
Ladislas. &#8220;Great God, it passes my comprehension.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going, sir?&#8221; asked Paul.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I am not. I promised Madame Drakona
to remain until her daughter returned, and shall
do so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; agreed Ladislas, pausing a second
as he strode up and down the room in great distress.
His excitement mounted fast, and his fears of coming
trouble in the city, caused by the ill news from
St. Petersburg and brought close home by the arrest
of Madame Drakona, oppressed him till the burden
became almost unbearable.</p>

<p>An hour and more passed in this way. Now and
again he would break into fitful heated discussion
with Paul and his sister; sometimes he turned to
me with feverish speculations about what would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
happen; anything in the effort to relieve the weight
of his trouble-laden thoughts.</p>

<p>Two or three times the telephone bell summoned
Paul; and each time he returned the three would
hold whispered counsel together; to end in the
same way, by Ladislas resuming his anxious pacing
of the room from end to end.</p>

<p>At last some message more disturbing than the
rest came.</p>

<p>&#8220;Paul and I must go. I dare not stay,&#8221; he
declared. &#8220;You will do what must be done here,
Robert. They are waiting for us, and God knows
what may happen if we do not go;&#8221; and paying no
heed to my protests, scarcely hearing them, indeed,
he and Paul hurried away.</p>

<p>Katinka and I sat on in grim silence.</p>

<p>I had caught some of the infection of Ladislas&#8217;
alarm at coming trouble; and my one concern now
was for Volna&#8217;s safety. Even the embarrassment
at the thought of meeting her again was dominated
by my fear for her; and I waited a prey to very
gloomy doubt and anxiety.</p>

<p>She came in not knowing that I was there. She
saw only Katinka as she entered with the question,
&#8220;Where is mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she saw me and started back in sheer astonishment.
Her eyes lighted, she paled slightly and
then the colour rushed to her face and with both
hands outstretched she came to me as a week before
at the priest&#8217;s house in Kervatje. &#8220;Is it really
you?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>I took her hands. &#8220;It is really I.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Katinka got up and coughed. &#8220;Of course
I am not surprised; but it is none the less scandalous,
sir, considering Volna&#8217;s mother has just been
taken to prison.&#8221;</p>

<p>The piteous look of pain and alarm on Volna&#8217;s
face as her hands fell from mine made me wish for
the moment that Katinka had been a man. I could
then have told her plainly some of the things I
thought about her.</p>

<small>DEFIANCE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;TO prison? Do you mean that, Katinka?&#8221;
asked Volna; her tone low and tense.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I usually say one thing and mean another?&#8221;</p>

<p>Volna turned swiftly to me as if seeking a contradiction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is my mother, Mr. Anstruther?&#8221;</p>

<p>Katinka&#8217;s large eyes flashed angrily. &#8220;Do you
wish to insult me, Volna, by appealing from me to
this new English friend of yours?&#8221;</p>

<p>Volna ignored her save for a gesture. &#8220;Mr.
Anstruther?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I stayed at your mother&#8217;s request to assure you
that she does not think it serious.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear, dearest mother!&#8221; A piteous cry of
sorrow and pity; and then a change to indignant
reproach. &#8220;This is your doing, Katinka, yours
and Paul&#8217;s and uncle&#8217;s; with your miserable plots
and schemings and intrigues! And having done
the mischief, you were such a coward as to leave
her to face the consequences alone. Shame on you!
If I had no other cause to hate your conspiracy,
your cowardice in this would make me do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be theatrical, Volna.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If it comforts you to cover your cowardice with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
a sneer, do so. I do not envy you the consolation.
I should have thought even you would be
ashamed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall not remain to be insulted before a
stranger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When the truth bites like an insult, I can understand
how it hurts to hear it. I shall go to my
mother, of course. You will help me find her, won&#8217;t
you, Mr. Anstruther?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course he will&mdash;for Ladislas&#8217; sake,&#8221; said
Katinka, turning to deliver her last shot as she
went out.</p>

<p>&#8220;What does she mean?&#8221; asked Volna with a
start. &#8220;She has so many barbs in her speeches.
But it doesn&#8217;t matter&mdash;nothing matters until we
find mother. Where do you think they have taken
her? How can we find out? Oh, I feel half distracted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think Colonel Bremenhof holds the key,&#8221; I
said, very quietly.</p>

<p>She was bending over a small table and looked up
instantly and sharply, hesitated and then replied:
&#8220;This must be explained. They have told you&mdash;about
him?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was just a suggestion of a challenge in her
tone; but the question gave me an opening to make
the explanation of my position, which had to be
made somehow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes. Ladislas told me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ladislas?&#8221; Surprise and a dash of indignation
in the tone.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>&#8220;No one could have a truer friend than you have
in Ladislas.&#8221;</p>

<p>To my consternation she broke in with a laugh:
&#8220;Why do you tell me this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is my friend also, one of my closest friends.
I am under a deep obligation to him. He saved my
life&mdash;I think I told you&mdash;at the peril of his own;
and to-day he told me not only about Colonel
Bremenhof but&mdash;but everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything?&#8221; There was no smile now, but
just a steady look.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are making me speak rather bluntly. He
told me, I mean, how deeply he cared for you and
he asked me to remain in Warsaw and come here to
try and be of some help to you&mdash;as your sister said&mdash;for
his sake.&#8221;</p>

<p>A pause of considerable embarrassment for me
followed. Then she said merely: &#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>

<p>I felt very awkward. &#8220;I think that&#8217;s all,&#8221; I
stumbled.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose I ought to be very much obliged to
Ladislas,&#8221; she said, and dropped her gaze upon the
table.</p>

<p>&#8220;His idea was that I could have helped your
mother and you to get away from the city.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On your way to England, of course?&#8221; she
asked, without looking up.</p>

<p>I hesitated. &#8220;Yes, on my way to England.
Father Ambrose urged me to go to England, you
know, as soon as possible; and General Eckerstein
also.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>&#8220;I hope you will have a pleasant journey. Warsaw
is just now a very questionable pleasure resort.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that my dismissal?&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked up and dropped the formal tone which
had hurt me. &#8220;I thought you wished to go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is harder still,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>She gave me her hand impulsively. &#8220;But you
don&#8217;t really think I wish to say things that hurt you.
After what you have done for me and what you
have had to suffer? Don&#8217;t go away with that
thought, please.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t wish to go away at all, until I have
been of some help to you. I wish only to make
things plain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, then we are not saying good-bye,&#8221; she
explained, drawing her hand from mine again, and
smiling; only to change the next moment to earnestness.
&#8220;Why surely you know there is no one
whose help I would rather have than yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For Ladislas&#8217; sake,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>Her eyes took a half wistful, half smiling expression.
&#8220;No matter for whose sake. We seem fated
to be always on a sort of half false footing to one
another. Strangers one hour, English the next,
then fellow conspirators, and then after that brother
and sister, and now&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She paused, as if at a
loss for a word.</p>

<p>&#8220;Friends,&#8221; I prompted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, always friends, I trust.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then let us try to think what can be done for
your mother.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>&#8220;My dear mother. I must see Colonel Bremenhof,
of course. Even with you to help me, the way
is very hard to see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I go to him with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>At that moment the door was opened quickly
and Colonel Bremenhof entered.</p>

<p>He was intensely surprised to find me in the room
and I think quite as angry. It was Katinka&#8217;s doing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your sister told me I should find you here,
Volna,&#8221; he said; &#8220;but not that any one was with
you. Least of all, Mr. Anstruther.&#8221;</p>

<p>Volna drew herself up and without taking his
outstretched hand asked: &#8220;Where is my mother,
Colonel Bremenhof?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have come to speak to you about her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They tell me you have had her arrested. Can
that be true?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish to see you alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Until my question is answered, I will not speak
to you alone; and if her arrest is your work, I will
never see you again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are many things to explain. Will you be
good enough to leave the room, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you please stay, Mr. Anstruther?&#8221; said
Volna quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Volna, I must see you in private. For your
mother&#8217;s sake. Now, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If Mr. Anstruther goes, I go,&#8221; she declared.</p>

<p>His face grew as dark as a thundercloud. &#8220;You
forget yourself, Volna. Does this gentleman
know&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>&#8220;That we have been betrothed? Oh, yes. It
was Mr. Anstruther who saved me from the police
at Bratinsk and afterwards. He naturally has my
entire confidence. I know him for a friend, and
he was about to start with me now to see you and
get the truth from you about my mother&#8217;s arrest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are making a very unfortunate admission
which may very greatly affect him.&#8221;</p>

<p>I couldn&#8217;t stand this. &#8220;Be good enough to leave
me out of the question for the moment, Colonel
Bremenhof,&#8221; I said. &#8220;I think I have shewn you
that I know how to take care of myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you dared to arrest my mother?&#8221; asked
Volna again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Madame Drakona is not arrested at all. Those
who are concerned in the matter of this national
trouble wish to ask her certain questions which she
will, I hope, be able to answer quite satisfactorily.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean by you &#8216;hope&#8217; she will be
able to answer?&#8221; was Volna&#8217;s prompt retort. &#8220;I
hope that even you would not stoop to the baseness
I can read under your words.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the absence of certain evidence, Madame
Drakona has nothing to fear. That is all,&#8221; he said,
doggedly. &#8220;Let us speak of this alone, Volna.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; she cried, with indignant emphasis. &#8220;Are
you so ashamed of your act that you dare not discuss
it? I know what you mean by what you call
the evidence against my mother. You used your
opportunities here and set your spies to scrape it
together and you keep it in your own hands, holding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
it over me to force me to comply with your wishes.
You are that kind of man. Now, what is your
price?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was as easy to see that she was right as that
her scorn and contempt struck right home. He
changed colour, twisted his beard nervously, glanced
at her, and from her to me; and stood baffled, disconcerted,
scowling and silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is your price? Are you ashamed to
name it before Mr. Anstruther?&#8221; she went on, in
the same bitter tone. &#8220;On what terms will you
consent to put that evidence in my hands? Can
you do it? If I should consent to pay the price,
what guarantee should I have, not only that you
could, but that you would, keep any bargain you
made? I should surely need some. I am ready to
save my mother. Now, what is your price?&#8221; Her
face flushed, her eyes shining, her manner eloquent
of her contempt for him, she presented a magnificent
picture of angry scorn.</p>

<p>He cut a pitiful figure in contrast, as he winced
and cowered under her words as under the lash of
a knout. He cared for her. There was no doubt of
that. But it was this very love which made him
suffer then. Hard, callous, cruel, indifferent to the
suffering he made others endure, he cringed now
under the mental torture she inflicted.</p>

<p>It galled him the more that of all men I should
be the witness of his humiliation; nor was I at any
pains to conceal my pleasure at his discomfiture.</p>

<p>When she spoke next, her tone was cold, quiet,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
and biting. &#8220;You are still ashamed to name it?
You would do the thing itself, mean and dastardly
as it is; but the mention of it harrows your delicate
sense of honour. You are a Russian, and worthy
of your country. You have thrown my mother into
prison in order to force me to marry you at once.
That is the price you will not name aloud; and that
is a price I will not pay.&#8221;</p>

<p>The frown on his face deepened ominously as he
muttered. &#8220;You are betrothed to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The one thing in my life I am ashamed of. It
was a sham betrothal, and you are welcome to the
truth now. I was at least honest with you. I told
you there was on my side none of that feeling which
a girl should have at such a time, and that I was
heart free. What I did not tell you was that the
betrothal was intended to save those about me from
danger at your hand. It served its purpose until
to-day, when you have struck this coward&#8217;s blow.
Now, thank God, the truth can be told.&#8221;</p>

<p>Chancing to glance into a mirror at this moment,
I caught sight of Katinka listening, white-faced, in
the doorway. At this avowal of Volna&#8217;s she threw
up her hands and hurried away.</p>

<p>&#8220;You admit you tricked me?&#8221; said Bremenhof
between his clenched teeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Call it what you will, I have told you now the
truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You understand what this means?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not afraid of you. Say what you will and
do what you will. I will save my mother in spite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
of you. Unless she is set free, your part in this
shall be made known. How you have constantly
held over me the threat of my mother&#8217;s arrest; how
at my instance you have failed to do your duty&mdash;if
it was your duty to arrest me&mdash;and how you have
abused your official power to serve your personal
ends with me. You have done your worst now;
and have failed. And if justice is not really dead
in Russia and we Poles are aught but your serfs, I
will see that if we are to be punished, you, our
accomplice, shall not escape your share of that
punishment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My God!&#8221; he exclaimed under his breath,
abashed for the moment by her magnificent boldness.
Then anger rallied him. &#8220;We will see,&#8221; he
muttered, and turned to leave.</p>

<p>I stepped between him and the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let him go, if you please, Mr. Anstruther. Let
him do what he dare.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without even another glance at her he went out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank Heaven the truth is out at last,&#8221; she
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder you had the courage. What will he
do?&#8221;</p>

<p>Before she answered, Katinka came in dressed
for the street and looking very angry and alarmed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are mad, Volna. I heard you. At such
a time as this to speak so. You have placed us all
in peril. You should be ashamed. Much you care
for your mother!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you can even guess how much,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
Katinka,&#8221; answered Volna very quietly. &#8220;Where
are you going?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anywhere rather than stay here after that.
You had no thought for Paul or for me, of course.
We are not safe another minute. Paul is with
Ladislas; I have warned him by the telephone. I
congratulate you, Mr. Anstruther, upon the disastrous
result of your interference.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must not say that, Katinka. This is not
Mr. Anstruther&#8217;s doing; it is my own act, and mine
only. But by all means save yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The police may be here at any moment to arrest
us all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why waste time in staying to reproach
me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Katinka&#8217;s great eyes flashed angrily. &#8220;Have
you taken leave of your senses?&#8221; she cried. &#8220;You
have never been like this before. It is sheer folly
and madness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I told him no more than the truth,&#8221; replied
Volna; adding after a slight pause: &#8220;One of the
really delicious moments of my life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You purchased your pleasure with the safety
of us all. Perhaps that will add to your enjoyment,&#8221;
retorted Katinka, as she hurried out of the
room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Katinka is eager for national independence, but
she does not like it in the family.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you suppose Bremenhof will do?&#8221; I
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t feel as if I cared at this moment. I am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
just revelling in my emancipation.&#8221; She threw
herself into a chair and leaned back clasping her
hands behind her head. &#8220;I suppose I did not
know myself; certainly I never realized before what
a capacity for deep feeling I have. I seem to be
waking up. Oh, how I hate that man!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think we should be doing something practical,&#8221;
I suggested.</p>

<p>She sighed impatiently and sat up. &#8220;You are
shocked because I tell you I can hate?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean merely that he may send to arrest you;
and you should be prepared.&#8221;</p>

<p>She rose. &#8220;If he does I must fall back upon
Ladislas.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ladislas?&#8221;</p>

<p>She crossed to the door, turned, and with a slow
smile I had learnt to know well, answered: &#8220;Did
he not get a promise from you to help me? I
should never have dared to do what I have done
to-day if you had not been here. But influence like
that has its responsibilities, also, you know, and
you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; The sentence was interrupted by the
servant who rushed in then.</p>

<p>&#8220;The police are here again, Miss.&#8221;</p>

<p>The loud summons at the house door confirmed
her ill news. Bremenhof had not left us long in
doubt as to what he meant to do.</p>

<small>A BLANK OUTLOOK</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">VOLNA appealed to me. &#8220;What shall I do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us get away if we can,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come then. We can leave the house by the
garden. But suppose they do not seek me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t risk waiting to find out If not, your
maid can call to us.&#8221;</p>

<p>We hurried to the door leading to the garden,
and as we closed it the servant admitted the police
at the front.</p>

<p>It was quite dusk and the heavy snow covered
the sound of our footsteps as we hurried through
the shrubbery to a small door in the high wall
which bounded the garden at the end.</p>

<p>As we paused a few seconds on the chance of the
servant recalling us, I whispered a warning to
Volna. &#8220;There may be some one posted on the
outside. Let me open it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She gave me the key and I turned it as softly as
the stiff lock would permit. I was opening the door
gently when it was pushed quickly, and a man
entered and seized Volna by the arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;We thought you might&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Before he could finish the sentence I grabbed him
by the throat. Fortunately for us he was a small
man and like a child in my hands. I gave him a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
pretty rough shaking and then pitched him backwards
into the middle of a wide laurel bush where
he lay kicking helplessly, struggling to extricate
himself, and gasping for breath to call for help.</p>

<p>Before he succeeded in getting out his first loud
cry we were out of the garden, had locked the door
upon him, and turned the first corner. We had to
run for it, and by good luck there was no one about
to notice us in the first two or three streets.</p>

<p>When we reached the main thoroughfare we
slackened our pace to a quick walk until we got a
sleigh which carried us out of the chance of immediate
pursuit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Almost like a moment of Bratinsk,&#8221; said Volna.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish we were there, or anywhere out of the
city. We&#8217;ll change sleighs in a minute.&#8221; I stopped
the sleigh soon afterwards at the door of an hotel,
and held the porter in talk while the driver whipped
up and left. Then we hurried away in the opposite
direction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now where are we going?&#8221; asked Volna.</p>

<p>&#8220;An old nurse of mine lives in the Place of St.
John, No. 17; I shall be safe there until we decide
what to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it far?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not too far to walk if you think that safer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do, because a sleigh driver can always be
found and questioned.&#8221;</p>

<p>During the walk, evidence of the popular unrest
was to be seen on all sides.</p>

<p>&#8220;The city is not like itself,&#8221; said Volna, as we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
crossed the great Square of St. Paul. The place
was half filled with groups of workmen engaged in
sullen discussion, while numbers of police stood at
hand watching. &#8220;Sunday evening usually finds
every one holiday making.&#8221;</p>

<p>We paused a moment near one or two of the
groups. Everywhere the subject of talk was the
same&mdash;the massacre at St. Petersburg.</p>

<p>Whenever we paused near any group I noticed
one or two men leave it, saunter up to us and scrutinize
us curiously. Whether they were police or
workmen it was impossible to say.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are interested in these matters, friend?&#8221;
asked one of them.</p>

<p>&#8220;All are interested,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;You were listening?&#8221; he returned suspiciously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I was listening.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are only two kinds of listeners in Warsaw,
sympathizers and spies. Those who sympathize
draw close; those who spy had better move
away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am a foreigner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are spies of all nationalities.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am no spy, but I&#8217;ll take your advice;&#8221; and
we moved on.</p>

<p>Almost every street corner had its cluster of men,
and always the talk was the same. If the workmen
of St. Petersburg were massacred, what could those
of Warsaw expect? Were they to go on suffering
like sheep? Which was the better, to be slaves for
the master&#8217;s gain, or to be men and resist?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>Two or three times the anger of the strikers took
violent form. Men were caught making notes of
the names of the talkers, the cry of &#8220;spy&#8221; was
raised, and in a moment fifty hands were outstretched,
fifty oaths leapt from wrathful lips, and
the victims were hustled, battered, kicked, and sent
sprawling into the gutters.</p>

<p>&#8220;And Ladislas believed there would be no violence,&#8221;
I said to Volna as we hurried on after one of
these episodes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor Ladislas! But I am frightened for what
will happen to-morrow. I have never seen this
temper among the people before. How will it affect
my mother&#8217;s case? If there should be any popular
outbreak, the difficulty of helping her will be infinitely
increased. The friends on whom we could
rely at any other time will then be helpless. They
are all Poles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is another way to look at it. Bremenhof&#8217;s
powers will be much greater and he can more
safely hold back the evidence against your mother
which you said he had. Is he really such a brute?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He boasted to me one day, when my mother
and I were at his house, that he had it in a private
safe, and that it rested with me whether it should
ever leave there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Umph! A courteous gentleman. Will he use
it now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I know him, he will not until he has given
up every hope of carrying his purpose with me.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>&#8220;Even after your splendid defiance of him to-day?&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled. &#8220;He has that quality which so often
wins&mdash;patience. I believe he suspected from the
first what the object of the betrothal was, and just
set himself to rivet the chain until I should not dare
to break it. While I was away he threatened my
mother that if I did not return at once, her arrest
would be used to force me back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, look at it as we will, he has us tied up in
a tangle bad enough to satisfy even him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not so bad as if his men had caught me
just now. He would have been much nearer his
end. So long as I am free, I can fight him; but he
knows what his power would be if he had both
mother and me in his hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was in truth a devil of a tangle. With Madame
Drakona in prison, Bremenhof had his hand on
the lever which controlled everything; and to get
her out seemed hopeless.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the Place of St. John,&#8221; said Volna,
presently. &#8220;That is the house, No. 17, across there.
I will leave you here. What will you do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall go to Ladislas and let him know what
has occurred.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor Ladislas! What do you think he can do?
You will find him with his hands full of more
serious matters than even my troubles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing could be more serious in his eyes,&#8221; I
said. &#8220;And you, what will you do?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>&#8220;Wait until to-morrow, that is all.&#8221; She spoke
with a rather weary smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is not the courage that defied Bremenhof.
The people may win in the impending struggle, and
then everything will be changed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They may,&#8221; she agreed, but with no hope in
her voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t believe it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is always hope.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We may find another way. Nothing is impossible
for such courage as you have shewn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is always one way open to me in the
last resort.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked up steadily. &#8220;What should I mean
but surrender?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not that, for God&#8217;s sake,&#8221; I cried impetuously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t think me a coward for naming it. It
would take all the courage you think I have. But
he knows how I love my mother, and that it would
kill her to remain in prison. To-morrow she must
be freed at any cost.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, don&#8217;t think of that. Think of your own
brave words in defying him.&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled again. &#8220;That is just it. Brave
<i>words</i>, nothing else. He knows they were but
words.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll find some other way. You&#8217;ll think differently
to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>She paused and then gave me her hand. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
try. If any one can give me confidence you can.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>&#8220;How shall I see you to-morrow? Is there any
risk in my coming to the house?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be better not. One never knows. I will
be in the Square of St. Paul&mdash;where the strikers&#8217;
meetings were&mdash;at eleven o&#8217;clock. But, remember,
my mother must be freed to-morrow at any cost.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I know what I have to do,&#8221; I answered,
confidently, &#8220;and I repeat, I&#8217;ll do it somehow.&#8221;</p>

<p>As I turned away, having watched her enter the
house she had indicated, I could not resist applying
the phrase&mdash;&#8220;brave words, nothing else&#8221;&mdash;to my
own resolve to find some means of bringing Bremenhof
to terms. I could see no way to make it
good, to make it more than mere words intended
to encourage her. It looked a sheer impossibility.</p>

<p>Short of calling the man and shooting him for
the old insult to me or forcing a fresh quarrel upon
him, there was nothing I could do, and the utter
futility of any such crude plan was too patent to
do more than increase my impotent anger.</p>

<p>I was hurrying to Ladislas&#8217; house when I remembered
that I had had no food for some hours and
had nowhere to sleep. So I went to the big hotel,
the <i>Vladimir</i>, and had dinner and engaged a room,
lest Ladislas should deem it imprudent for me to
stay with him.</p>

<p>As I sat over my dinner brooding, it appeared to
me that the only hope for Volna lay in the success
of the popular movement; and after dinner I lingered
some time in the streets, intensely interested
in the progress of affairs.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>The excitement and general unrest were certainly
increasing fast, and the temper of the people was
rising. The groups of strikers were growing
larger. In some places crowds had gathered, and
were openly cheering speakers who no longer took
pains to lower their voices. In many places the
agents of the Fraternity were busily distributing
leaflets embodying the workers&#8217; demands. There
were many proofs of this growing confidence.</p>

<p>More than once the police and the people came
into open conflict; and each time the police were
worsted, to the great delight and manifest encouragement
of the crowd. Then, as men moved from
one spot to another, the idea of a procession was
generated; bands were formed and united, and
began to parade the streets. And in all places at
all times men appeared ready primed to take the
lead, all acting together as though the whole work
had been carefully prepared and rehearsed.</p>

<p>A blind man could have seen that grave trouble
was in the making, and I saw abundant proof that,
although such leaders as my friend might counsel
peaceful methods, the populace were in that ugly
mood which would lead them to laugh at peaceful
counsels and to rely on force and violence.</p>

<p>It was a night of such crisis for the city that I
was surprised to find the authorities apparently
heedless of the rapidly growing peril.</p>

<p>At Ladislas&#8217; house, however, I had a glimpse of
their plans. There were lights in some of the windows
and everything was apparently as usual. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
servant admitted me and when I asked for my
friend, he ushered me into the library, saying his
master would come to me directly.</p>

<p>Instead of Ladislas, however, a stranger came&mdash;a
young man, well-dressed, courteous, and politely
insinuating.</p>

<p>&#8220;The leaders of the Fraternity are now in conference
and the Count cannot leave them for the
moment. Will you join them or can I carry any
message?&#8221;</p>

<p>He referred to the Fraternity with a sort of
secretive suggestiveness; but it nevertheless surprised
me that the subject should be mentioned so
openly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can wait,&#8221; I said. &#8220;I merely wish to see him
privately.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me carry a message. He may be some time.
On such a night as this the meeting must necessarily
be lengthy. I am in his confidence, his private
secretary, in fact,&#8221; he added, when I made no reply.
&#8220;And of course, in full sympathy with him in all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know he had a secretary, but you will
probably know my name, Robert Anstruther.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, are you Mr. Anstruther? Yes, indeed. I
am glad to meet you, if you will allow me to
say so. You have probably come to see him
about&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221; He paused as if inviting me to finish
the sentence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed pleasantly. &#8220;You will think it very
stupid of me, but in the multiplicity of things which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
in this crisis in the city have crowded upon me, I
have lost the clue. Let me think;&#8221; and he put his
hand to his forehead as if in perplexity.</p>

<p>He was evidently a very sharp, clever fellow, but
it struck me that his sudden forgetfulness was a
little overacted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not surprised you can&#8217;t remember it,&#8221; I
said with a smile intended to be as frank and
pleasant as his.</p>

<p>A quick glance from his keen eyes, not intended
for me to notice, put me further upon my guard.
&#8220;That is very good of you. But I take it what you
have to say is for the Count&#8217;s own ears?&#8221;</p>

<p>I looked steadily at him a moment. &#8220;I am
thinking where I have seen you before,&#8221; I said,
preparing to make a shot.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not had the pleasure, I am sure,&#8221; he
replied, with another smile; deprecating this time.
He had as many different smiles as a woman. &#8220;I
do not forget faces and should instantly recognize
such a friend of the Count as Mr. Anstruther, if
we had met before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have it,&#8221; I exclaimed, banging my hand on
the table. &#8220;You were in the Police Headquarters
when I was arrested and taken there from Solden.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a good guess, and his surprise unmasked
him for an instant. &#8220;What do you mean, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That you are an agent of the Department.
Your people arrested me as a conspirator and imprisoned
me until my friend, General von Eckerstein,
explained the mistake. Count Ladislas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
Tuleski and I are old friends, and as the General
has advised me to leave Warsaw, I did not wish to
go away without bidding my friend good-bye. But
I suppose you have raided the house, and made it
a trap for any one you think you should suspect.
Not a nice trick perhaps, but then our English
methods differ from yours. Now, how do I stand?
Do you wish to repeat the farce of arresting me?&#8221;</p>

<p>In view of the ugly incident with the police agent
when helping Volna to escape, I was a great deal
more anxious about his reply than my easy smile
may have led him to believe.</p>

<small>POLICE METHODS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WE dallied with the question and I thought he
was going to repudiate my suggestion; but
after a slight pause his manner became official.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you recognize me, there is no reason for
further concealment. We are in possession of the
house and my object was to learn the purpose of
your visit. I invite you to tell it me plainly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is merely personal and private. If I leave
Warsaw to-morrow, I shall not have another opportunity
to see my friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A mere friendly call? At such an hour as this?
On one of the leaders of the conspiracy which is
threatening the whole city?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is no novel experience for me to make a
statement which at the time is not believed by the
agents of your Department and to have the truth
proved later.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where have you come from?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I dined at the <i>Hotel Vladimir</i> about a couple of
hours ago; since then I have been in the streets.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Also for private and personal purposes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am an Englishman and always interested in
watching the results of misgovernment. A mere
personal interest, of course.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>He liked this no better than I intended. &#8220;Your
visit here to-night is full of suspicion, sir, and the
account of your movements very difficult to believe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In England such a remark would be treated as
an impertinence; but there we manage matters
differently, and even police officials speak the language
of courtesy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is not England,&#8221; he said with a sneer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank God that at least is true. But all the
same, need we ruffle one another&#8217;s tempers? I am
ready to do what you wish, I can&#8217;t help myself, of
course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is your address?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The night before last I was a guest of your
Department in the fortress of Kreuzstadt. Last
night I stayed at the house of my friend, General
von Eckerstein. To-night I meant to ask Ladislas
to put me up; and to-morrow I might be on my
way to God&#8217;s country once more. As it is, I shall
return to the <i>Hotel Vladimir</i>, unless of course you
have any&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; and I waved my hand to indicate
that he might like to finish the sentence.</p>

<p>&#8220;My instructions are to send all who come to
this house to the Department. One of my men will
accompany you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am ready,&#8221; I answered, curtly. &#8220;It is a pity
you did not act on your instructions before and
save time, instead of trying to trick me into admissions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can make your explanations there, sir,
and lodge any complaint you please,&#8221; he replied;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
and in a few minutes I was on my way to the
Department in charge of one of his subordinates.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are an Englishman?&#8221; he said, after he
had been eyeing me very curiously for some time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, with no great opinion of your methods of
government.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From London?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, from London.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been in London,&#8221; he answered in excellent
English.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder you ever came back here, then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was some time there, in Soho. It was in
London, I suppose, you met Count Ladislas Tuleski?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There and in other places. Has he been
arrested to-night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. He would have been, but some one gave
him notice that his house was to be raided; and of
course he fled.&#8221; He laughed as though this were
a joke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Strange how these official secrets get tapped?&#8221;
I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Fraternity has friends in many quarters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Has it?&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed again, rather drily, this time, and
answered with a shrewd glance. &#8220;Of course you
don&#8217;t know. Any one calling at the Count&#8217;s house
at such a time would not.&#8221;</p>

<p>What was he driving at? His manner suggested
more than a mere desire to pump me. I made no
reply, waiting for him to develop the thing.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>&#8220;My name is Christian Burski. You may know
it,&#8221; he said next.</p>

<p>&#8220;How should I, an Englishman, know the names
of the Warsaw police?&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed at this first and then said meaningly,
&#8220;Not of all the police, of course. But mine is well
known.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it? I don&#8217;t envy you your reputation, all
the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, you have no sympathy with the police.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A kind of sport in which I&#8217;d rather be hunted
than hunter.&#8221;</p>

<p>He smiled. &#8220;That&#8217;s good. I like your way,&#8221;
he replied; and then lowering his voice and speaking
earnestly, he added: &#8220;Is this visit to Headquarters
likely to be serious for you? Are you
suspect?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One would scarcely go to such a place on a
night like this from choice, I suppose?&#8221; I answered
lightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of trouble brewing in the streets
and it would be easy for a man to get away from a
single guard.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a bribe, I concluded. &#8220;Will you smoke?&#8221;
I asked him and handed him a cigar. We stood to
light up and as the match flared between us our
eyes met. &#8220;Why do you say this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As a peasant farmer, friend,&#8221; he laughed.</p>

<p>I held the match to his cigar and he pulled at it,
keeping his eyes the while on me. &#8220;You seem in a
hurry,&#8221; I answered, laughing in my turn.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>&#8220;Immediate,&#8221; came the due response.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your name?&#8221;</p>

<p>Up went his left hand as he gave me the sign.
&#8220;In the eye of God.&#8221;</p>

<p>I thrust out my hand.</p>

<p>He looked at me steadily and would not take it.
It was proof enough.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you give notice of the raid?&#8221;</p>

<p>He nodded. &#8220;Yes. If you don&#8217;t wish to go to
the Department, we&#8217;ll get into one of these crowds;
you can knock me over and get away.&#8221;</p>

<p>I thought quickly. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think it matters.
But you can help me in a much more important
affair. Have we a friend in Colonel Bremenhof&#8217;s
house&mdash;his private house?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am there myself,&#8221; he answered, with his dry
smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Could you get me admittance?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, impossible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I were once inside could you help me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At the risk of both our lives.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When will you be there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To-morrow, I expect. To-night, the raids on
the Fraternity leaders have brought every special
among us on duty. To-morrow, the military will
be called out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I am not detained at the Department to-night,
could you bring me a police uniform to the
<i>Hotel Vladimir</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. One of mine. We are pretty much the
same height. By whose orders?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>&#8220;To serve Count Tuleski. There are certain
papers in Colonel Bremenhof&#8217;s safe which we must
have.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Impossible,&#8221; he said, with a shake of the head.
&#8220;He carries the key always; and when he is absent
a man is always posted in the room.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which room is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The library. The room at the back of the
house on your left as you enter. But there are
usually half a dozen men on guard in the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At what time after dusk does the Colonel return
home?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At six&mdash;he dines with his mother and sister.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you see me in the house to-morrow you will
contrive to be on hand, should any one be called by
him. That is all. God keep us all,&#8221; I said, remembering
Jacob Posen&#8217;s parting salutation at Kervatje.</p>

<p>&#8220;God keep us all,&#8221; he repeated.</p>

<p>We reached the Department soon afterwards and
after a short delay I was taken in to Bremenhof,
who received me with a half-suppressed, malicious
chuckle. My guard, Burski, reported that I had
called at Ladislas&#8217; house and the explanation I had
given.</p>

<p>Bremenhof sent him out of the room. &#8220;I
scarcely expected to see you here again so soon,&#8221;
he said, when we were alone. &#8220;We have another
charge waiting for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can answer any charge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you wish to communicate with your friends
this time?&#8221; he sneered. &#8220;Scarcely so, I imagine.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
General von Eckerstein pledged himself that you
were no revolutionary. Why then did I find you at
the Drakonas&#8217; house this afternoon; why did you
aid the escape of a suspect; and follow it with this
night visit to the house of a Fraternity leader?&#8221;</p>

<p>I smiled. &#8220;You are not alarming me, Colonel
Bremenhof. I am no revolutionary. I went to the
Drakonas&#8217; house because my friend Count Ladislas
Tuleski urged me to help him in protecting from
you the woman he hopes to marry&mdash;Volna Drakona;
I helped her to escape when you sent to arrest
her; and I went to my friend&#8217;s house to tell him
what I had done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The woman <i>he</i> is to marry?&#8221; he exclaimed with
a scowl. Then with a vicious curl of the lip: &#8220;So
you admit that you helped in this escape?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should I deny it? You have the proofs.
Your man would identify me. You can charge me
with the offence, but of course in that case the
reasons for the suspect&#8217;s arrest must be gone into
fully. And you see I know them thoroughly.&#8221;</p>

<p>He saw his dilemma. &#8220;I did not say I should
charge you, only that you have now committed an
act which at such a time of crisis carries serious
consequences.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was my turn to chuckle; but I had more to gain
than merely turn the tables on him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have done nothing which I am not perfectly
willing to make known publicly anywhere. When
I learned my friend&#8217;s sentiments and hopes in
regard to Miss Drakona, my own object was instantly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
changed. But for his persistence, I should
probably have left Warsaw to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>This drew a long, keen, searching look on me.
&#8220;Does Miss Drakona know this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you aware of the charges against Count
Tuleski? That if made good, they may involve a
life sentence, or at least, Siberia?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you tell me this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are shrewd enough to understand, Mr.
Anstruther.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not discuss such a question.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If this matter against you is not pressed, will
you leave Warsaw?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can I? I have agreed to be examined
to-morrow about the Bratinsk matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>He waved an impatient hand. &#8220;I can arrange
that, of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will go on condition that Madame Drakona
is at once set at liberty and the evidence you are
holding back is placed in my hands, and that Miss
Volna Drakona is absolved from all responsibility
for the affair at Bratinsk.&#8221;</p>

<p>I looked for an outburst of anger at this; but he
listened closely and then sat thinking, a heavy
frown on his dark face.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is behind that?&#8221; he asked after the pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;That Miss Drakona must be a free agent to
become the wife of my friend if she will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Free to go to Siberia?&#8221; he sneered; &#8220;or perhaps
you mean to England?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>&#8220;There is an end of the thing. I have no use
for a man who doubts my word.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You forget how grossly I have been deceived
already.&#8221;</p>

<p>I made no reply, but leant back in my chair,
crossed my legs, and shoved my hands into my
pockets with a great show of unconcern.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is Miss Drakona?&#8221; I took no notice.
&#8220;Can you communicate with her?&#8221; I took a paper
from my pocket and began to read it. &#8220;If I agree,
when will you leave Warsaw?&#8221; I made a pencil
note on the paper, folded it up and put it away with
a sigh of weariness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not mean to doubt your word. I retract
what I said.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s another matter. We can resume. Provided
you keep faith with me throughout. Then,
as soon as Madame Drakona is free and you have
handed me the evidence against her and satisfied
me that the charge against her daughter is settled,
I will go by the next train?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On your word of honour?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On my word of honour.&#8221;</p>

<p>He thought for a moment. &#8220;You can arrange
to leave to-morrow night. There will be certain
formalities to settle of course. I will see to them
to-morrow. Come to my private house to-morrow
at six o&#8217;clock and I shall be prepared with everything.
Are you still with General von Eckerstein?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>&#8220;No. I shall stay to-night at the <i>Hotel Vladimir</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can go. Oh, by the way,&#8221; he added in a
tone of indifference; &#8220;your manservant has
been brought here with your luggage from
Bratinsk.&#8221;</p>

<p>Something in his manner struck me. His indifference
seemed forced. &#8220;Is he a prisoner?&#8221; I
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no. Not now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let him bring my things to the <i>Vladimir</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>He struck his table bell. &#8220;This gentleman has
been brought here needlessly,&#8221; he said to the man
who came. &#8220;He has certain instructions to give
about his manservant. See that they are carried
out. Good-night, Mr. Anstruther.&#8221;</p>

<p>I left the message for Felsen, and as I was passing
out I saw Burski. He gave me a quick glance
of congratulation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going, you see,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did no more than my duty,&#8221; he answered, for
those about us to hear.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no grudge against you. I hope you will
always do no less than your duty.&#8221;</p>

<p>He noticed the equivocal phrase. &#8220;I think I can
be depended upon,&#8221; was his equally ambiguous
reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night. I am going to the <i>Hotel Vladimir</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is nothing to me. Good-night.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>I moved off; and just then some one called out&mdash;&#8220;Burski,
the chief wants you.&#8221;</p>

<p>I turned my head at the call; and was just in
time to catch his eyes fixed upon me with an expression
which set me thinking as I stepped into the
street and started for the hotel.</p>

<p>It was a look which suggested that the mask was
off in that moment.</p>

<p>Had he been just fooling me?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII<br />


<small>SPY WORK</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT is never pleasant to have to admit even in the
secrecy of one&#8217;s own private thoughts that one
has been fooled; nor does the cleverness of the
fooler afford any but the coldest consolation.</p>

<p>Yet when I sat down to think things over calmly,
I could come to only one conclusion&mdash;that in my
trial of wits against Bremenhof and his agents I
had been wofully worsted.</p>

<p>A little thing will suffice to start suspicion; and
in this case it was that strange look which I had
surprised on Burski&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>Once started, however, my suspicions gathered
like snow flakes in a drift, and quickly hardened
into certainty. Everything seemed to be as highly
charged with doubt, as a bomb with dynamite. I
could see how I had just played into their hands,
like a countryman in the care of a gang of sharpers.</p>

<p>Why should Bremenhof give in about Madame
Drakona; and to me of all men? He had cunningly
led me to believe that it was because of my
changed relations in regard to Volna. But mine
were little more than blank cartridges; yet he had
waved the white flag the instant I fired one at him.</p>

<p>I could see now how unreal the whole interview
had been. He had read my purpose and had just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
played with me, keeping his own plan cunningly
concealed. He meant to use me for that plan.
What was it? And how did he mean me to help
him?</p>

<p>There was the matter of Felsen, too. Why had
Bremenhof been at the pains to render me a service?
I had not been so dense as not to notice that his
indifference in mentioning Felsen was feigned.
What object had he in sending the man back to me
at such a moment?</p>

<p>I recalled the interview I had overheard between
Felsen and the police agent at Bratinsk. The police
had brought him to Warsaw now. What had been
the relations between them in the interval? Were
they going to use him as a spy? It looked very
much like it.</p>

<p>Then I thought of Burski and grew hot with
shame at the easy manner in which I had let the
fellow trick me with his use of the Fraternity signal
and pass words, and his offer to let me escape. He
had been fooling me of course; and had succeeded
with his subtler effort after his superior at Ladislas&#8217;
house had failed. It was all part of the system of
spy work: and by this time Bremenhof knew everything
and was no doubt laughing at me and setting
the snare which was to complete my overthrow.</p>

<p>Sackcloth and ashes may be hard wearing apparel;
but they don&#8217;t hurt as much as the stings of
such humiliation as I felt in realizing my self-satisfied
stupidity and the ease with which I had been
gulled.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>The one redeeming point was that my eyes had
been opened before it was too late; and the question
was whether I could still get out of the mess into
which I had blundered.</p>

<p>I soon guessed the drift of Bremenhof&#8217;s scheme.
It was to ruin me by convicting me of complicity
in the Fraternity conspiracy; and in the meanwhile
to use me to enable him to find Volna. Felsen was
no doubt the chosen spy for the latter part; and
Burski for the former.</p>

<p>My first step was obvious. I must not let either
man know that I suspected him.</p>

<p>With Felsen this was easy. When he arrived I
talked over matters with him; listened to the story
of his sufferings on my account; promised him a
liberal reward for what he had endured; and did
my best to make him feel that he still had my
confidence.</p>

<p>With the police agent, Burski, I had to be much
more wary. I had already had proofs of his shrewdness;
and I found him prepared with an explanation
of his call to Bremenhof as I was leaving the
Department.</p>

<p>He sent up his name openly, and as the hotel
servant was leaving the room he said, with official
curtness: &#8220;A letter from Colonel Bremenhof.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a formal notice that my examination had
been postponed.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are alone?&#8221; he asked in a low voice.</p>

<p>I nodded. &#8220;I have only this room.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>He drew a chair close to mine. &#8220;We are in luck.
You noticed that the chief sent for me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; and was a little surprised.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A rare stroke of fortune. He suspects you and
questioned me closely as to what I had got out of
you on the way to police quarters. You know we
agents are supposed to trick a prisoner into admissions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An infernal system it is, too; but they can&#8217;t
get at me. They had me for nearly a week; but
I have friends, and they were forced to let me go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must be careful, friend. You are to be
watched and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Here he smiled very slyly&mdash;&#8220;The
chief has picked me out for the work. Is not
that luck?&#8221;</p>

<p>He was evidently pretty sure of me. &#8220;I can&#8217;t
quite understand that,&#8221; I said, as if in doubt. &#8220;As
a matter of fact I found the Colonel willing to do
all I asked.&#8221; Then I became apparently confidential;
that is, I told him just as much as I surmised
Bremenhof would have told him already; and referring
to the visit to Bremenhof&#8217;s house, I laid special
stress on the fact that Ladislas, as a leader of the
Fraternity, had assigned the task to me.</p>

<p>He pledged himself to help and questioned me
as to my object.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that all?&#8221; he exclaimed, with a shrug of the
shoulders when I said my object was merely to get
the papers. &#8220;He is so hated and feared that I
hoped&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; here he dropped his voice to a whisper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
and looked intently and meaningly at me&mdash;&#8220;that
your orders went farther.&#8221;</p>

<p>I understood him. &#8220;I am an Englishman, friend,
and no assassin,&#8221; I said firmly.</p>

<p>He made as if to conceal a natural disappointment.
&#8220;And this uniform.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A disguise to enable me to get the Count&#8217;s
friends away under the pretence of an arrest. But
I doubt now if I shall need it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused. &#8220;A shrewd plan indeed; but not so
far-reaching as I had looked for and hoped. It is
best for friends to be frank.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Count himself as you know is dead against
all violence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The time is past for mere talk; we must act,&#8221;
he exclaimed, with an excellent suggestion of suppressed
excitement; and he sought to lead me to
discuss the affairs of the Fraternity.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not a leader and have only to do the task
assigned to me,&#8221; I said. &#8220;Let others do as they
will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You believe our freedom can be won without
violence?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have only to do the task assigned to me,&#8221; I
repeated; and would not be drawn any farther.</p>

<p>As he was going he referred to Felsen. &#8220;You
trust your servant? You know he is also suspect.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know he is a good servant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not trust him too far. He talks too freely.
Be on your guard; and don&#8217;t let him see this uniform.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
He will know that I have brought it; and the
knowledge might be dangerous to both of us.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a clever stroke for one spy to put me on
my guard against the other; but my eyes were no
longer blinded; and his warning did not mislead me.</p>

<p>I was fully alive to the personal risk I was running,
and I spent a couple of hours in very anxious
thought, recasting my plans for the next day. In
the end I resolved to act as though implicitly believing
in Bremenhof&#8217;s sincerity, and saw how to use
one of his own spies to let him know my intention.</p>

<p>In the morning I wrote a note to Volna.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Dear Miss Drakona</span>,&mdash;I am glad to tell you
that in an interview I had with Colonel Bremenhof
last night he agreed to hand over to me the evidence
against your mother and also to place it on record
that there is no charge of any kind against you.
He imposed one condition; and I shall comply with
it by leaving Warsaw to-night. I think it better
not to call upon you this morning. Therefore I
send this by my servant, Jacob Felsen, who is to
be trusted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you earnestly, God-speed, and shall
always be</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">&#8220;Your Friend,</span><br />

&#8220;<span class="smcap">Robert Anstruther</span>.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>I addressed this openly to Volna and gave it to
my servant.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going to trust you with a very important<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
secret, Felsen,&#8221; I said as impressively and earnestly
as I could. &#8220;The safety of the person to whom this
is addressed may depend upon your good faith. I
cannot go to the place myself, but I feel I can rely
upon your doing all I look for from you in the
matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>He answered with a hundred protestations of
fidelity; and was so over-insistent that I was quite
sure he meant to take the letter straight to Bremenhof,
who would either hurry to the house himself
or send to have Volna brought to him. He would
thus find that I had given the right address and
was apparently acting, as my letter implied, in reliance
upon his word.</p>

<p>But as I was careful that Felsen did not leave my
hotel until it was impossible for Bremenhof or his
men to get to the Place of St. John before Volna
had left to keep her appointment with me, I was
risking nothing in giving away her real address.</p>

<p>As soon as he was gone I started to meet her. I
found Burski in the hall of the hotel smoking a
cigar and chatting with some other men.</p>

<p>I concluded that I was to be shadowed and that
he was there to point me out to whoever might be
detailed for the work.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, good-morning, Mr. Anstruther,&#8221; he said,
coming up to me.</p>

<p>I stopped and returned his greeting. &#8220;What is
the news? Is the trouble over?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, indeed. It is going to begin. The men in
almost every factory and workshop in the city have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
struck work: every policeman is on duty, and the
soldiers are being held in readiness. It will be a
black day for Warsaw.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There will be violence, you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do men get together in thousands and tens of
thousands just to shake hands with one another?
You are not going out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed I am. I have a free day&mdash;my last possibly
in Warsaw&mdash;and I wish to see matters for
myself. Where are the strikers in force?&#8221;</p>

<p>At this moment a man who was sitting near the
door rose and sauntered out, followed soon afterwards
by a second. I marked them well; for I
guessed they might be told off to shadow me.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are in force everywhere,&#8221; he replied.
&#8220;Shall you be long away?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come with me and show me things? One
direction is as good as another for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He drew me aside and lowered his voice to a
whisper: &#8220;I am supposed to be following you, you
know. But if you tell me when you&#8217;ll get back here,
it will do.&#8221; Such a clever assumption of sincerity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Frankly, I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; I did not; but not for
the reason I wished him to infer. &#8220;I may soon have
had enough of it.&#8221; And with that I went to the
door, glanced up and down the street, and then
strolled off as though I had no purpose beyond the
merest curiosity.</p>

<p>I soon perceived that I was being followed by the
two men I had seen leave the hotel; and a well
trained Russian sleuthhound can be very difficult<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
to shake off. But I had a plan for doing this; and
luck soon favoured me.</p>

<p>In one of the side streets off Noviswiat Street, the
great business thoroughfare, a crowd of strikers
stood listening to a very excited speaker. I got into
the middle of them and just when he was abusing
the employers and cursing the police for taking
their side against the workers, I pointed out the two
sleuths to the men close to me and whispered that
they were police spies. The news spread like burning
oil on water; and when I slipped away, the two
men were the centre of a fierce, threatening mob
and far too much concerned for their own safety to
care what became of me.</p>

<p>The incident had delayed me seriously, however,
and a glance at my watch showed me it was already
a quarter past eleven, the hour for my appointment
with Volna.</p>

<p>I had at least a mile to go and after a sharp walk
for a couple of hundred yards, I hailed a sleigh.</p>

<p>Then the unexpected happened. &#8220;The Church
of St. Paul as fast as you can,&#8221; I called to the man
as he pulled up; and I was stepping quickly into
the vehicle when some one laid a hand on my
shoulder.</p>

<p>I turned quickly; and to my infinite chagrin I
found it was the agent, Burski, a little out of breath,
but smiling and evidently on excellent terms with
himself.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIV<br />


<small>BLACK MONDAY IN WARSAW</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;I &nbsp;WAS almost afraid I shouldn&#8217;t catch you
up,&#8221; said Burski.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you couldn&#8217;t get away?&#8221; I growled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I managed it all right. I thought it would
be a pity for you to miss anything I could shew you
on your last day in the city; and such a day; so I
hurried after you. Nearly lost you in that crowd,
though. Going to the Church of St. Paul, are you?
That&#8217;ll make a capital starting point. Jump in.&#8221;</p>

<p>But it was not in my programme to take him to
meet Volna. &#8220;No, I think as you&#8217;re with me, we
shall see more if we walk,&#8221; I replied, and I tossed
the driver a rouble and dismissed him.</p>

<p>Burski laughed. &#8220;That illustrates one of my pet
theories,&#8221; he said; &#8220;that you English are sometimes
a most changeable and impulsive people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not interested in your theories about my
countrymen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I won&#8217;t force them on you. I hate a man
who is always cramming his views down your
throat. He&#8217;s a bore&mdash;the poorest sort of creature
in the world. Which way shall we walk?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All ways are the same to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us stroll on then. It will take us to the
Church of St. Paul.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>I was so angry, so perplexed how to shake him
off, and at the same time so anxious to get to Volna
that I would not trust myself to speak. Every minute
of delay increased the risk that she might tire
of waiting&mdash;or jump to the conclusion that I could
not keep the appointment&mdash;and go back to the house
where I knew Bremenhof&#8217;s men might already be
waiting for her.</p>

<p>Burski acted as though he saw nothing of my
uneasiness. He chatted away quite unconcernedly,
calling my attention now to a church and again
to some public building; and accepting my
monosyllabic surly replies with unruffled complacency.</p>

<p>Once chance offered of getting away. A great
crowd of strikers came marching past, filling the
roadway, and as the accompanying mob of stragglers
surged on to the footpath, I was about to
plunge into the midst of their ranks when he slipped
his arm into mine and drew me back into a doorway.</p>

<p>&#8220;For Heaven&#8217;s sake be careful,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;The
scum of the city is there, and your very life might
be in danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>It appeared as though he might well be right; but
I could have cursed him for his forethought all the
same.</p>

<p>The strikers themselves looked formidable enough.
There were several hundred of them, stem-faced
men all; resolute, silent, determined, dogged, as
though moved by a common deep-set purpose, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
maintained a rough order of march, leaders at the
head and on the flank of each band.</p>

<p>The mob hanging on their skirts were of a very
different class, however; ill-clad, dirty, unkempt tatter-de-malions,
the dregs of the alleys and by-ways
of the city, ripe for any mischief or devilment. Evil
men and worse women, they shuffled and scrambled
and hustled along, with occasional cheers for the
strikers, hoarse cries and oaths to one another, and
execrations for the government: a towsled, disorderly
rabble, unquestionably dangerous, and high-charged
with thoughts and hopes of violence. It
would not be their fault if the day ended without
open resistance, looting and bloodshed.</p>

<p>For many minutes precious to me they filled the
streets and made progress impossible; and before
they had passed, a clock near by struck twelve.</p>

<p>An hour past the time at which I was to have met
Volna. She would surely have given me up and in
all probability had already gone back to the house
to which in my fatuous confidence in my own
cleverness I had been reckless enough to send
Bremenhof.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where have the strikers come from?&#8221; I asked
Burski, as a sudden thought chilled me.</p>

<p>&#8220;From where we are going, the Square in front
of the Church of St. Paul. They have an ugly look
and we shall have Petersburg over again, if they
don&#8217;t shake themselves free from the rabble. And it
may be even worse here, for the Fraternity have
brought in arms and are prepared to resist. There
will be fighting before night.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>&#8220;Spoken very much like a police agent that,&#8221; I
exclaimed.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders. &#8220;One gets the habit,
I suppose. I was a police agent long before I joined
the Fraternity; and one judges of things from that
standpoint at times. See, they have swept the
Square clear,&#8221; he added, as we reached the Church.</p>

<p>&#8220;And at this point we&#8217;ll part company, please.&#8221;</p>

<p>He assumed great surprise. &#8220;Part company?
Why we have seen scarcely anything yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean what I say.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused and then his manner changed. &#8220;I am
really sorry for this, Mr. Anstruther.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry for what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, I have seen that I was not wanted,
but the fact is I myself am being watched. I am
compelled to keep with you for an hour or so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You suggested just now that you came because
I had asked you,&#8221; I rapped back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you did ask me, didn&#8217;t you? And you
put it so naturally that I really thought you were
in earnest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t. I don&#8217;t wish to be seen by our friends
to-day in the company of so well known a police
agent as yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us see then how we can manage it? The
simplest way will be for me to drop behind. The
friends won&#8217;t know we are together, and my superiors
will see I am obeying orders.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t wish to be shadowed either.&#8221;</p>

<p>He spread out his hands with an air of bewilderment.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
&#8220;For the sake of the Fraternity I must not
lose my position in the Police. You see that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see one thing which is enough for me. I am
not going to be shadowed. You may as well understand
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But we are not going to quarrel, surely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If necessary we are.&#8221;</p>

<p>He sighed as though I were most unreasonable.
&#8220;It has always been one of my pet theories&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hang your theories. Are you going to persist
in following me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I am not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then go your way and leave me to go mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I will do that.&#8221;</p>

<p>But he kept at my side. &#8220;Then go back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well. I am sorry I have annoyed you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shan&#8217;t be annoyed if you leave me now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad to hear that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you are still coming on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am thinking.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Square was nearly deserted and I looked
everywhere for Volna. The clock chimed the quarter
past the hour. She was not there.</p>

<p>I pulled up. &#8220;I have had enough of this. What
are you going to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a suggestion. Let us go to Colonel
Bremenhof and tell him. He is close here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Place of St. John, No. 17.&#8221;</p>

<p>I turned on him so angrily in my surprise that he
drew back a pace and his right hand went to his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
pocket, where I guessed he had a revolver. But he
forced a look of indifference, and keeping his eyes
on mine jerked his head in the direction.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is only a short distance across the Square
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was now quite clear my scheme had gone
wrong. Either Volna had been prevented from
coming to meet me; or, having come had been scared
away by the mob, or had given me up. If she had
returned home, she was already in Bremenhof&#8217;s
power; and the sooner I knew of it the better. On
the other hand, if she was not there, and he or his
men were, I could confront him with the proof of
his double dealing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why we shouldn&#8217;t adopt the suggestion,&#8221;
I said, indifferently. &#8220;If Colonel Bremenhof
has ordered me to be shadowed, I may as well know
why. We&#8217;ll go there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This way then,&#8221; he replied, adding after a
pause, &#8220;I trust you won&#8217;t misunderstand my position,
Mr. Anstruther.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why are you so anxious about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have been so badly treated by the Department,
for one thing; and of course, as a fellow
member of the Fraternity, I am bound to help you
all I can. But you don&#8217;t seem to trust me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you know Colonel Bremenhof was at
this address, the Place of St. John?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He sent me word this morning.&#8221; He told the
lie very plausibly and without the slightest hesitation.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>&#8220;You know his affairs pretty closely&mdash;what do
you suppose he is doing there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should know well enough but, you see, I
haven&#8217;t been either at headquarters or at his house
since last night, when I left to see you at the <i>Hotel
Vladimir</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should find it easier to believe you if I had not
myself sent the address to him this morning at a
time which made it impossible for him to have communicated
it to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has a hundred secret sources of information.
He must have known this long before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>He spread out his hand. &#8220;How otherwise could
he have sent it to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If he did send it,&#8221; I retorted drily.</p>

<p>He stopped abruptly as though an idea had just
occurred to him. &#8220;Wait. Wait. How did you
send it to him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By my servant, Felsen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then that is it,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;I suspected that
fellow. It was he who told me the address, declaring
the chief had sent the message by him. He is a
traitor, that servant of yours. The scoundrel.&#8221; He
was quite hot in his indignation.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you said he was suspect,&#8221; I reminded him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wished to warn you. I told you he talked. I
wish I had spoken more plainly. But you are so
quick, I thought you would understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am beginning to now,&#8221; I replied, as we hurried
on.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>As we reached the Place of St. John the noise of
a great tumult reached us from the direction in
which we had seen the strikers marching; the subdued
roar of thousands of hoarse voices, followed
first by some desultory shots and then by the rattle
of musketry firing.</p>

<p>The people about us paused, and then began to
run in the direction of the sound.</p>

<p>&#8220;It has begun,&#8221; said Burski. &#8220;The troops are
stationed by the Government Buildings and the
strikers have come in conflict with them.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was to the accompaniment of this ominous
music of revolt that we approached the house. A
small force of police were gathered before it, and I
scanned the windows eagerly for some sign of
Volna&#8217;s presence. I saw nothing.</p>

<p>There was a short delay before we were admitted.
Burski drew aside two of the men and during the
short discussion, curious looks were cast at me. In
the end way was made for us and we were allowed
to pass.</p>

<p>The moment we were inside Burski said: &#8220;We
must wait here;&#8221; and another man who was in the
passage placed himself by my side.</p>

<p>It looked very, very much as though I had walked
into a trap and was once more under arrest.</p>

<p>I glanced at Burski. &#8220;What does this mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>For answer he shrugged his shoulders and threw
up his hands as though he was as perplexed as I.
&#8220;Simply the orders, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV<br />


<small>NO. 17, THE PLACE OF ST. JOHN</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WE stood silent for perhaps a minute and I
strained my ears for the sound of voices
in the rooms near. Not so much as a whisper was
to be heard.</p>

<p>Presently the stairs creaked above, and I saw a
woman, tear-stained and troubled-looking, peering
cautiously down at us.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing there? Come down,&#8221; said
Burski, quickly.</p>

<p>I guessed that she was Volna&#8217;s old nurse, and
that she had been listening above stairs. She came
down, her eyes full of alarm.</p>

<p>&#8220;In which room are they?&#8221; I asked, sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;The back&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she began, pointing to a door,
when Burski stopped her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Silence,&#8221; he interposed.</p>

<p>But I had the information I needed and sprang
past him and ran up the stairs. &#8220;You must not go
up, Mr. Anstruther,&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not? I am no prisoner,&#8221; I answered; and
before he could prevent me, I had reached the door
and entered the room, Burski at my heels, to find
Volna in a condition of mingled defiance and distress,
and Bremenhof pacing the floor angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the meaning of this?&#8221; he cried.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>&#8220;That is exactly what I have come to see,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>Volna got up. &#8220;Is it true, Mr. Anstruther, that
you sent this address to Colonel Bremenhof?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Should this man remain to hear what has to be
said?&#8221; I asked Bremenhof, pointing to Burski.</p>

<p>He found the question an awkward one. Unwilling
to let Burski overhear the conversation and
yet equally unwilling to remain without some protection,
he was at a loss what to do.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take the key of the door with you, Burski, and
remain within call,&#8221; he said, after a pause.</p>

<p>I waited until we three were alone and then
answered Volna&#8217;s question. &#8220;It is possible that
Colonel Bremenhof obtained the address through
me. How <i>did</i> you get it, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>But Volna did not wait for him to answer. &#8220;He
has told me more than once that in consideration
of his allowing you to leave the country, you betrayed
my address to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>I turned to Bremenhof. &#8220;Do you repeat that
now in my presence?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have no right to come blustering here,&#8221; he
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you repeat that story of my treachery now
in my presence? Come. Dare you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t think to intimidate me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you would not dare. Now, will you
tell Miss Drakona what really passed last night; or
shall I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;These matters cannot be gone into now. You
must both come to the Department and the whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
thing shall be&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; I put my back against the door
and he took alarm instantly. He broke off and said
quickly: &#8220;My men are here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will not call them yet, Colonel Bremenhof,&#8221;
I said very deliberately.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you presume to threaten me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a personal matter between Miss Drakona,
yourself and me. You have slandered me to
her, and your official position cannot and shall not&mdash;understand,
shall not&mdash;prevent your giving an
explanation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll soon see about that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t call your men. I warn you;&#8221; and I put
my hand to my pocket as though I had a weapon
concealed. I had none; but he was not a difficult
person to bluff; and my look was steady enough to
frighten him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Anstruther!&#8221; exclaimed Volna, in alarm.</p>

<p>&#8220;This matter must be set straight, Miss Drakona.&#8221;
My tone was as firm to her as it had been
to him; and this served to complete his discomfiture.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Colonel Bremenhof, I am waiting.&#8221;</p>

<p>He sat down and was as troubled and fidgetty as
a schoolboy waiting for a birching. His eyes were
everywhere in the room, his lips moved nervously,
and his fingers played with his beard. But he said
nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will help you to start. You gave me your
word last night that Madame Drakona should be
released to-day; that you would place the evidence
against her in my hands at your house to-night; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
that all charges against this lady should be withdrawn.
Is that true?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; that is what I have explained,&#8221; he muttered.</p>

<p>&#8220;The express object, as I told you plainly, was
that Miss Drakona should be a perfectly free agent
to marry my friend Count Ladislas Tuleski or not
as she chose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have said that too, in effect.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In effect!&#8221; cried Volna contemptuously.</p>

<p>&#8220;The one condition you imposed was that I
should leave the country, and to that I agreed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is only your way of putting it,&#8221; he said,
beginning to gather courage as the minutes passed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wrote as much to you this morning, Miss
Drakona, and gave the letter to my servant, Felsen,
to bring to you. Have you received it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Colonel Bremenhof has given it to me, Mr.
Anstruther.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Turned letter carrier, eh?&#8221; said I, drily.</p>

<p>&#8220;The explanation of my possession of it is perfectly
simple. Your servant was arrested by one of
my men this morning; and when he was searched,
the letter was found upon him. I deemed it best to
bring it here myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And to add that I betrayed the address to
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your man told me that you had instructed him
to bring it to me. Of course, he may have lied.
But how was I to know that?&#8221;</p>

<p>His air of blameless innocence, as palpably false<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
as his explanation, was laughable; but it was my cue
at the moment to accept both.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is only one thing that really matters,&#8221; I
declared. &#8220;Are you prepared to keep your word
to release Madame Drakona, to give up the evidence
against her, and to certify officially that there is no
charge against Miss Drakona here?&#8221;</p>

<p>His start of anger and the vicious look he shot
at me showed that he appreciated the tight corner
in which this put him. He was hesitating how to
answer, when unfortunately Volna&#8217;s indignation
would not be restrained.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you are satisfied with the explanation, Mr.
Anstruther, I am not. Colonel Bremenhof&#8217;s charge
against you was of deliberate, not involuntary betrayal.
That it was part of your pledge to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>I raised my hand in protest; but it was too late.
He saw his chance and took it at once cunningly.
He rose and said: &#8220;If I am already judged, nothing
more can be done here. Burski!&#8221; he called in
a loud ringing voice.</p>

<p>I stepped from the door and Burski and the second
man entered.</p>

<p>&#8220;You called, Colonel?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are going to the offices of the Department.
Let the Englishman be searched. He has
a weapon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Burski drew his revolver and turned to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you are mistaken. I know what you
thought. See!&#8221; and I turned my pocket inside out.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t resist.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>Resistance being useless, it was just as well to
make a virtue of offering none.</p>

<p>&#8220;You threatened me,&#8221; said Bremenhof.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that the charge against me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The charge will be explained in proper time,&#8221;
he snapped.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I will see that the explanation is proper,
too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Silence!&#8221; he cried. Now that his men were
present, his natural instincts as an official bully
reasserted themselves.</p>

<p>It was an ugly development of the situation; and
my chagrin was the more bitter because only my
own blind self-confidence had brought it about.</p>

<p>Volna blamed herself, however, setting it all down
to her last angry interposition. &#8220;I am so sorry,&#8221;
she said to me. &#8220;This is my fault.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a bit of it. He meant to do it in any case.
You only made it a little easier for him to show his
hand. The real blame is mine, as I will explain
to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The explanation will have to wait,&#8221; sneered
Bremenhof. &#8220;You have many other things to explain
first. See that a carriage is brought, Burski,
for Miss Drakona to go with me. You will take
the Englishman. Take him away now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Volna gave a cry of distress, and was coming
toward me when Bremenhof pushed between us.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must not speak to the prisoner,&#8221; he said,
bluntly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Mr. Anstruther,&#8221; said Burski.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>&#8220;You need have no fear on my account, Miss
Drakona,&#8221; I assured her, as I went out with Burski.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the reason for this?&#8221; he asked, as we
stood a moment on the landing, after he had sent
his companion for the carriage.</p>

<p>&#8220;It means that for the moment you have out-played
me&mdash;for the moment, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can I help you?&#8221;</p>

<p>I looked at him steadily. &#8220;Yes, by dropping
your pretence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You wrong me, friend. I can still help you to
escape. I can get you out of the city, if you will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Colonel Bremenhof&#8217;s orders, eh? No, thank
you; not again. I am just as anxious to be a prisoner
now as he is to get me out of the city.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He means mischief for you. I told you last
night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You told me many lies last night and acted
others. And I have had quite enough of them and
of you. Now, go ahead and do as he told you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders. &#8220;If you get to
Headquarters it will be too late,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>At that moment his comrade came running up.
&#8220;If the prisoners are to be taken, Burski, you&#8217;d
better come. There&#8217;s a crowd of the strikers
close by.&#8221;</p>

<p>Burski looked at me sharply.</p>

<p>I smiled. &#8220;May be a bit awkward for you, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>We went down to the front door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is the carriage there yet?&#8221; asked Burski.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just driven up,&#8221; was the reply.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>The clamour of a crowd outside reached our ears.
I put out my hand to open the door and Burski
stopped me. He was looking very anxious. &#8220;Call
the chief,&#8221; he said hurriedly.</p>

<p>The man sprang up the stairs.</p>

<p>Burski and I were left alone.</p>

<p>The clamour outside increased and some one
knocked at the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you open the door? If you are in
earnest about helping me to escape, let me call in the
crowd.&#8221;</p>

<p>Instead of replying he drew his revolver.</p>

<p>The knock was repeated, and a voice called:
&#8220;Burski, Stragoff, either of you. Quick, man,
quick, if you&#8217;re coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>The noise of the crowd was growing every moment,
and my guard&#8217;s perplexity grew with it.</p>

<p>The door of the room above us was opened, and
Bremenhof called, &#8220;Burski, Burski. Are you
there?&#8221;</p>

<p>Attracted by the call his eyes left me a moment.
The next I had his revolver hand in mine, and,
having the advantage of the surprise, wrenched it
away from him.</p>

<p>He called out, and Bremenhof and the second man
came running down.</p>

<p>The noise without shewed that the crowd were
close to the house. I threw the door wide
open.</p>

<p>Two men were on the doorstep and fell back at
the sight of the weapon in my hand.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>The crowd were close at hand, streaming past the
corner of the Place of St. John.</p>

<p>I fired two shots in the air. At the sound the
crowd turned and faced towards me.</p>

<p>&#8220;The police are here. Rescue! Rescue!&#8221; I
shouted with all the strength of my lungs.</p>

<p>A loud roar of angry shouts answered me, and a
number of the men breaking from the crowd came
pouring toward the house.</p>

<p>The police agents outside darted away like hares.</p>

<p>At the same instant Burski and the others seized
me; and after a short, fierce struggle I was dragged
back inside and the door was slammed just as the
first comers from the mob reached the house.</p>

<small>THE TABLES TURNED</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE tables were turned now, and as the mob
howled and clamoured and hammered at the
door, a braver man than Bremenhof might well have
lost his nerve.</p>

<p>He was pale, and trembled, partly with anger,
but more with terror, as he stared at me in doubt
what I would do next.</p>

<p>The chances of the struggle had left me nearest
the door; and as I had retained possession of Burski&#8217;s
revolver, I had command of the situation.</p>

<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t let them in,&#8221; he said, as the hammering
at the door increased in violence, and the crowd
yelled for it to be opened. &#8220;They&#8217;ll tear us to
pieces if you do. For God&#8217;s sake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are willing to keep your word now, I suppose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, in everything. Everything,&#8221; he replied
eagerly.</p>

<p>Then Burski, who was as cool and collected as his
chief was agitated, made a move the purpose of
which I was to see later. He whispered to his companions,
and Bremenhof hurried back up the staircase
and the other man ran away to the back of the
house.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>&#8220;Now, Mr. Anstruther, we must face this out
together. What are you going to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>Those outside were battering at the door with a
violence that threatened to break it down every
moment. A heavy stone was hurled through the
small glass light above it, and a loud cheer greeted
the smash.</p>

<p>I turned and threw the door open and then his
object was made plain.</p>

<p>As I opened it, he sent up a great shout.</p>

<p>&#8220;Help! help!&#8221; he called, in ringing stentorian
tones. &#8220;Thank God you have come, friends. The
rest of the cursed police have bolted, but I&#8217;ve kept
this one from escaping. My fellow prisoners are
upstairs.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a clever ruse; and in an instant a dozen
hands shot out eagerly to grab me. I sprang back
and Burski tried to block my retreat; but I thrust
him away and reached the stairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop. This is a trick,&#8221; I shouted. &#8220;That is
the police agent. I am an Englishman. It was I
who fired the shots just now and called for help.&#8221;</p>

<p>A babel of oaths and confused cries greeted this;
and the men in front halted a moment in hesitation.</p>

<p>Burski saw the hesitation. &#8220;He lies, like the
police dog he is, to save his skin,&#8221; he called. &#8220;Look
at the weapon in his hand. Some of you will know
the police pattern.&#8221;</p>

<p>A yell of execration followed this cunning stroke,
as the crowd threatened me.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>&#8220;I took it from him,&#8221; I said; but I was not
believed and a rush was made at me again.</p>

<p>To stop this I backed up the narrow stairway and
levelled the weapon at them. Those in front flinched
and hung back at the sight of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you want any further proof,&#8221; cried Burski.
&#8220;Is there any leader of the Fraternity here? I can
soon convince him.&#8221; His cool audacity was wonderful.</p>

<p>A cry was raised from some one; and a pause followed
while a new comer elbowed his way to Burski.
A shout greeted his coming, and all eyes were upon
the two as they interchanged a few words in low
tones. What passed I do not know, probably some
secret sign was given; and it sufficed.</p>

<p>&#8220;This man is one of us,&#8221; was the verdict; and
at the decision a deafening yell of rage and curses
broke out as the mob turned to me again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Police spy. Liar. Dog. Down with him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hear me,&#8221; I shouted; but my voice was
drowned in the curses of the mob.</p>

<p>Another rush was made at me, to be stopped
again by the levelled revolver.</p>

<p>Then the new comer held up his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you are a friend give up your weapon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Clear the house of all except yourself and one
or two more and I will. I can convince you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you want to walk into a police trap,
friend?&#8221; asked Burski, with a sneer. He had the
crowd with him now and they echoed the sneer with
a laugh.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>But the leader was a persistent fellow in his way.
&#8220;How many are in the house?&#8221; he asked Burski.</p>

<p>The latter shrugged his shoulders. &#8220;There were
plenty just now; enough to treat me pretty roughly;
and I&#8217;m no bantling.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are no police in the house except that
man and one other. He knows that,&#8221; I declared.</p>

<p>The leader turned to the crowd and tried to reason
with them; but it was useless. Not a man would
leave the house. Some began to murmur and growl
at him for his interference; and the yells and cries
against me redoubled in violence.</p>

<p>Then for a while things went all wrong with me.
One of the fellows in the hallway picked up a mat
and with a raucous laugh and an oath flung it at
me. It hit me full in the face; and a burst of laughter
and wild cheering hailed the shot.</p>

<p>Before I knew anything more, another man
rushed up the stairs and caught me by the legs.
Down I went backwards, my weapon flew out of
my hand, and in an instant I was hauled down the
stairs, feet first into the seething mass of infuriated
men; grabbed here, thrust there, beaten, kicked and
hustled all ways at once, to the accompaniment of
such screeching, oathing and yelling as I hope I may
never hear again, at least under similar conditions.</p>

<p>Matters would have been much worse with me,
indeed, but for one stroke of luck. One of the
crowd, a grimy, vile-smelling creature, in his eagerness
to get a kick at my head fell asprawl over me
as I lay against the wall; I grabbed him tight and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
hung on to him, using his fat carcass as a shield
until his piercing screams for help let his friends see
what was happening.</p>

<p>The attack ceased while they dragged him free.
I managed to scramble to my feet at the same time,
and with my back to the wall I used my fists right
and left upon the front rank of hot, straining, sweating,
staring faces in a desperate effort to win a way
back to the stairs.</p>

<p>Against such numbers I could gain no more than
a moment&#8217;s respite, however. But it proved enough.</p>

<p>A revolver shot rang out from the stairway and
drew all eyes that way.</p>

<p>It was Volna.</p>

<p>Running from the room above she had seen my
pistol on the stairs and her quick wits had suggested
to her the means of stopping the tumult. She had
discharged it over the heads of the crowd and had
thus gained a hearing.</p>

<p>Her lovely face flushed and her eyes alight with
indignation, she used the moment of astonishment
to dash right into the midst of the crowd and reach
my side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shame, men, shame,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Would you
tear your friends to pieces? I am one of the prisoners
and this is the other.&#8221;</p>

<p>The fickleness of a mob is a proverb. Her plucky
act succeeded where all arguments and inducements
would have failed. The crowd swung over to her
side and cheered her lustily.</p>

<p>Burski was quick to appreciate the probable results<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
to him; and I saw him begin to edge his way
to the door to escape.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop that man,&#8221; I called, pointing to him.</p>

<p>In an instant his path was blocked; and I hoped
that he was going to have a taste of the treatment of
which he had secured such a full meal for me.</p>

<p>He would have had it surely enough but for an
interruption from outside.</p>

<p>The luck had turned right in our favour. Three
or four men shouldered their way into the house
and in their midst I saw my friend Ladislas. He
was known to many of the crowd, who made way
for him with a loud cheer.</p>

<p>In a few words I made the situation clear to him,
and added that Bremenhof was in the room above,
and that if the crowd got wind of it in their present
temper, they would tear him to pieces.</p>

<p>He succeeded ultimately in inducing the people
to leave the house; and putting Burski in charge of
three men, Ladislas, Volna and I went up to Bremenhof.</p>

<p>He was in a condition of desperate terror and, as
we entered, started up and stared at us wide-eyed,
trembling and abject.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are in no danger, Colonel Bremenhof,&#8221;
said Ladislas. &#8220;They shall take my life before I
will see you harmed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not quite so fast as that, Ladislas,&#8221; I declared.
&#8220;Colonel Bremenhof knew what his man, Burski,
intended in setting the crowd on me, and I have a
reckoning to settle.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>The hunted expression in his eyes which had been
calmed somewhat by my friend&#8217;s words, returned
as he asked: &#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall know that in a moment. First understand
that the mob are still outside&mdash;their blood
is up. They have just been cheated of one victim,
myself, handed over to them in your stead by the
cunning of your man and with your connivance. I
have but to open the door and speak your name to
them: and what they did to me will be a trifle to
what they&#8217;ll do to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anstruther!&#8221; protested Ladislas.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is my matter, man. Leave it to me, please.
If you&#8217;d been down under that mob&#8217;s feet, you&#8217;d
feel as I do. Now you,&#8221; and Bremenhof cowered
again as I turned to him. &#8220;Listen to me. Even
when I was in danger of my life, I kept secret the
fact that you were here in the house; and saved your
life. Out of no regard for you, believe me; for I
swear that if you refuse to do exactly what I tell
you now, I will drag you down with my own hands
and pitch you into the midst of the rabble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But little more than you promised me last night.
Madame Drakona&#8217;s release at once, and the delivery
of the evidence you hold against her, an
official statement that there is no charge of any
kind against her daughter here; and a definite
written admission of the part you have taken
throughout this. You&#8217;ll play no more tricks
on me.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>&#8220;Yes, I agree. I&#8217;ll do it the instant I get to the
Department.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you. I know how you keep such pledges.
You will write the order for Madame Drakona&#8217;s
release here at once and will send it by Burski, your
trusted servant, with orders to conduct her to a
place we&#8217;ll settle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But at such a time difficulties may be raised
and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes or no, quick. As for the difficulties, you&#8217;ll
remain in our hands until you have found how to
get over them. Burski was clever enough to get
me into a mess a few minutes since. Now you can
use his cleverness to get you out of one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Let me see him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One word. You are earning your life; understand
that. Attempt any treachery and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; I
left the sentence unfinished.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do it,&#8221; he agreed. &#8220;Anything. Anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>Volna fetched some writing materials and while
Bremenhof wrote the order, I conferred with Ladislas
and settled the details of the plan.</p>

<p>We dared not stay longer in that house because
the police would soon be back in great force to
Bremenhof&#8217;s rescue; and Ladislas named a place
to which we could take him. But we could not have
Madame Drakona brought to the same place, because
Burski would in that event take the police
with her. We arranged, therefore, that Madame
Drakona should be taken to her own house.</p>

<p>Moreover, as the kernel of everything was to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
prevent Volna&#8217;s arrest, she could not go home to
receive her mother; but that difficulty the telephone
solved for us. We settled to wait at the place to
which Ladislas would take us until a telephone message
from the Drakonas&#8217; house assured us that
Madame Drakona was there and alone.</p>

<p>When the order was ready I fetched Burski.
Bremenhof gave him his instructions, and I said
enough to convince them both that Bremenhof&#8217;s
safety depended entirely upon their keeping faith
with us.</p>

<p>Ladislas then explained matters to the leaders of
the mob. The crowd had meanwhile decreased in
numbers, and those who remained were induced to
disperse.</p>

<p>A carriage was fetched and we four started,
leaving Burski in charge of a couple of the men who
had come with Ladislas, to be dispatched on his
errand as soon as our carriage was out of sight.</p>

<p>We had done well so far; but there was still
much to do. A slight check to the plans at any
moment might mean the ruin of everything. If the
luck lasted, we should win, and only complete success
could justify the desperate move I had taken.</p>

<p>Would the luck last?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVII<br />


<small>THE PLAN PROSPERS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IF Bremenhof had been less of a coward such a
plan as ours would have been absolutely impossible.
But the sight of the mob&#8217;s fury had so saturated
him with fear that it bereft him of the power
to make even a show at resistance.</p>

<p>I did my utmost to play on that terror. During
the short ride, I sat opposite to him, holding in full
sight the revolver which had already done us such
conspicuous service; and when we reached our destination
I linked my left arm in his as I walked
him into the house, taking care that he should see I
still held the weapon ready for use.</p>

<p>What I should really have done had he made an
effort to escape I don&#8217;t know; but I am sure I had
convinced him that I should shoot. That fear of
me made him my slave. He watched my every
gesture, started nervously when I looked at him,
and flinched whenever I spoke.</p>

<p>As soon as we were in the house I set him to work
to write the official declaration that he had investigated
the charges against Volna, and had found
them unfounded; and then the full statement of the
part he had played throughout.</p>

<p>Volna meanwhile called up the servant at their
house, and having ascertained that no police were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
in possession there, told the girl how to call us up
the instant that Madame Drakona should reach
home.</p>

<p>There was nothing more to be done but to wait
for that message. I left Volna and Ladislas together
and remained with Bremenhof.</p>

<p>The extent to which he was subject to my influence
during the hours in that house was remarkable.
To me quite unaccountable indeed. He was as
docile as though I had possessed hypnotic power and
had used it to subdue him.</p>

<p>With the revolver always carefully in hand I sat
and stared at him steadily, sternly, continuously in
one long, tense, dead silence. I concentrated all
my thoughts upon the one essential object, to force
the conviction upon him that death would be the
instant penalty of resistance to my will.</p>

<p>Twice only was the silence broken. Once when
he showed me what he had written and I ordered an
alteration; and once at the close when I asked him
how he was going to get for me the evidence against
Madame Drakona.</p>

<p>This was the one thing in which I could not see
the way. I must have it before the spell of fear I
had cast upon him was broken; and yet I knew,
from what Burski had told me on the previous night,
the difficulties which were in the way. What Bremenhof
said now confirmed this, and he was so
panic-saturated that I believed he was past lying.
He professed himself as anxious as I was to solve
the difficulty.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>The problem was this. The papers were in the
safe in his library, and there was a man on guard
over it; Bremenhof had the key with him; and
he had given the most absolute order that no one
should even enter the room in his absence.</p>

<p>If I went to the house myself with the key and a
written authority from him, it was in the highest
degree unlikely, that, being unknown, I should be
allowed to get to the safe. It was very likely indeed
that, on such a day of tumult, I should fall under
suspicion, and be promptly placed under arrest.</p>

<p>Volna was known to the servants and was thus
less likely to fail; but I was loath for her to run the
risk. Burski might be back at the house, and he
knew enough of the matter now to understand that
her arrest would checkmate our whole scheme.</p>

<p>Bremenhof protested that if I would let him go,
he would give up the papers. &#8220;I pledge you my
solemn word of honour. I&#8217;ll take any oath you
please, do anything you ask.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To whom can you give them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come with me, and I will give them to
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you. I know how you keep faith. I
won&#8217;t walk open-eyed in another of your traps.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll send them to you, then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; by a strong body of police with orders to
take me back with them. I know the risk I&#8217;ve run
now in bringing you here, and have no fancy for a
march across the plains. You must find some other
means. Otherwise I shall hand you over to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
strikers to be held until we are out of this cursed
country.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For God&#8217;s sake,&#8221; he cried, nerve-racked and
abject at the thought; and after that I resumed the
silent watch which he found so trying an ordeal.</p>

<p>After a time Volna came in.</p>

<p>&#8220;My mother is free, Mr. Anstruther. She is at
home; the agent, Burski, took her there and no
police are left in the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, I have kept faith,&#8221; said Bremenhof
eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see that you couldn&#8217;t help it, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On my honour I will do all I have promised.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When the devil&#8217;s sick he makes an earnest
penitent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I renounce all claim to this lady&#8217;s hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What the wolf said when he was in the trap.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My God, what do you mean to do then?&#8221; he
cried, tossing up his hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean to have that evidence. I will adopt your
own suggestion and go to your house with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Anstruther!&#8221; protested Volna.</p>

<p>&#8220;Leave this to me, please,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I pledge my honour you will run no risk,&#8221; declared
Bremenhof.</p>

<p>Volna&#8217;s lip curled at this mention of his honour.
&#8220;You will not trust him? You cannot. You must
not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me speak to you,&#8221; I said. We went outside
leaving the door ajar that I could watch Bremenhof.
&#8220;I can trust myself in this if not him. Let your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
mother leave the house for some place where she
will be safe until you can join her. You must both
remain in hiding, prepared to leave the city the
instant we can get you away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she interposed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please. I shall come to no great harm. We
have taken a risk with Bremenhof to-day; but with
the proofs against your mother in our hands and
with the papers he has signed here to-day, my friends
can put up a fight on my account which, even if
he dares to face it, will get me out without much
trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must not run this risk,&#8221; she protested.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have put the worst that can happen even if
he breaks faith and arrests me; but I have him so
frightened, I don&#8217;t believe he will dare to attempt
any tricks. I have a way to keep him scared, too.
Where is Ladislas? I want him to get a sleigh with
a driver who can be relied on in an emergency.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like it. We have no right to ask anything
of this kind of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must do what I ask, please.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no. I would rather run the risk of arrest
myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That would do no good now. He has all this
against me just the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can leave the city. Besides, if I agree to
do what he&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall quarrel if you say that again. And I
hope we are too good friends for that.&#8221;</p>

<p>She placed her hand on my arm and looked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
earnestly in my eyes. &#8220;You don&#8217;t know how this
tries me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is for Ladislas&#8217; sake,&#8221; I said steadily.</p>

<p>She bit her lip and dropped her eyes. &#8220;I would
rather anything than this,&#8221; she murmured hesitatingly.
There was a pause full of embarrassment to
me; then, rather to my surprise, she looked up with
a smile: &#8220;I had forgotten. I agree,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>Her sudden change of manner puzzled me.</p>

<p>She saw my surprise. &#8220;You have convinced me,
that is all. I had forgotten.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Forgotten what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is never too late to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She paused.</p>

<p>&#8220;To what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To remember what I can still do,&#8221; she replied
cryptically. &#8220;I will tell Ladislas about the sleigh.&#8221;
And without more she smiled again and left me.</p>

<p>I returned to Bremenhof.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have sent for a sleigh to take us to your
house. You have given me your word that I shall
be safe&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I swear it,&#8221; he cried eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going to trust to it, but not without taking
a precaution on my own account. My liberty
will be in your hands while I am in your house; and
you had better know that I would rather lose my
life than be sent to your cursed mines in Siberia.
Get that clearly into your mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I swear to you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind about any more swearing. You
know by this time that I mean what I say. And I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
mean this. I know the risk I have run to-day, and
rather than let your men make me a prisoner I will
blow my brains out. Unlike you, I am not afraid
of death. Mark this well, then. I shall not die
alone.&#8221; I paused, and added with all the tense
fierceness I could put into my tone and manner.
&#8220;If you give me the slightest cause to suspect
treachery, even to suspect it, mark you, that instant
will be your last in life. From the moment we leave
this house together to that when I leave yours with
the papers in my possession, I shall be at your side,
this barrel against your ribs, and my finger on the
trigger. Try to trick me, and by the God that made
us both, I swear I&#8217;ll shoot you like a dog.&#8221;</p>

<p>He gave a deep sigh, the sweat of fear clustered
thick on his grey-white forehead, and he sank back
in his chair.</p>

<p>He was so drunk with fear that he was past
speech. He looked up once or twice as if to speak,
and his blanched lips moved; but the moment his
eyes met mine he faltered and trembled and looked
down, his tongue refusing to frame the words.</p>

<p>Presently Ladislas came in.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish to speak to Colonel Bremenhof,&#8221; he
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not now, Ladislas,&#8221; I said. I would not have
the effect of my threat lessened by any distracting
thoughts.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish to make him understand we have done
all we can to prevent violence in the city.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go away, please. I have given him all I want<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
him to understand for the present. Let me know
when we are to start.&#8221;</p>

<p>Greatly wondering, my friend yielded and left us
alone again.</p>

<p>With intentional ostentation I looked to the loading
of my revolver. Bremenhof watched me furtively;
and each time I looked up from the task, he
shrank and drooped his head.</p>

<p>At last Ladislas called that the sleigh was waiting.
&#8220;The driver has his orders,&#8221; he whispered,
&#8220;and will bring you to us afterwards.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; I said to Bremenhof, as I rose.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are wronging me, Mr. Anstruther,&#8221; he
stammered, as he got up unsteadily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can apologize afterwards,&#8221; said I drily.</p>

<p>As we were leaving the house Volna stood waiting
for us, and would have spoken to me; but I
would not leave Bremenhof&#8217;s side.</p>

<p>I was wearing a long cloak, and as Bremenhof
and I crossed the pavement to the sleigh, I pressed
close to him and let him feel my weapon against his
body.</p>

<p>He started and caught his breath in fear. The
strain had told on him. He staggered in his walk,
and his face wore the grey look of one on the verge
of death.</p>

<p>So long as I could keep him in that mood I was
safe enough.</p>

<p>We got into the sleigh in silence, and had barely
turned out of the street when a body of troops came
in sight riding in our direction.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>&#8220;This will test your sincerity,&#8221; I said. &#8220;As
well now as later. Remember my oath.&#8221;</p>

<p>At a sign from the leader our driver drew to one
side and pulled up.</p>

<p>I thrust the barrel of the pistol hard against
Bremenhof&#8217;s side. The officer recognized him, and
with a salute halted his men.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are in a hurry and cannot delay,&#8221; I whispered.</p>

<p>Bremenhof returned the salute and waved his
hand for the troops to pass.</p>

<p>The officer ordered his men to make room for the
sleigh and we dashed on at a high speed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; I said, suppressing a sigh of relief.
&#8220;You have learnt your lesson, I see.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVIII<br />


<small>FLIGHT</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE meeting with the troops proved to be an
invaluable incident.</p>

<p>There had been a tense moment when the question
whether Bremenhof would attempt treachery
still hung in the balance. A moment more thrilling
than any I had ever known in my life.</p>

<p>With his lame and craven submission, however,
a change seemed to come in everything. That I
could compel him to cross the city in broad daylight
when hundreds of his police and soldiers were
swarming everywhere, and so frighten him as to
prevent him raising an alarm, had seemed in anticipation
little more than the merest forlorn hope.</p>

<p>But when at the first test he had yielded abjectly,
my confidence was so strengthened and my domination
over him so confirmed, that the thing became
almost simple and commonplace.</p>

<p>We met other bodies of police and military as we
dashed over the snow to the merry peal of our
sleigh bells, but not once was there even the threat
of trouble.</p>

<p>It was rather as though we were making a tour of
inspection together, jointly interested in the police
and military preparations for coping with the excited
populace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>We passed many evidences of the popular unrest.
But Ladislas had apparently given the driver very
shrewd instructions as to his route, for not once did
we drive through a street where any actual disturbance
was in progress.</p>

<p>More than once we saw conflicts going on between
the troops or police and the mob. But always from
a safe distance. More than once, too, we passed
where trouble had broken out. Wrecked houses
and workshops told of the anger of the people, and
grim patches of bloodstained snow testified that the
troops were not in the city for nothing.</p>

<p>Here and there we passed strikers whose limping
walk, bandaged limbs, or bleeding faces bore evidence
of recent fighting; and we drove rapidly past
more than one small group gathered pale-faced and
sorrowful about a figure stretched at length on the
snow. These things told their own tale.</p>

<p>Twice Bremenhof was recognized, and howls and
shouts and bitter curses were hurled at us. Once
we were followed, stones were thrown, and even a
couple of shots fired after us; but the swiftness of
our horses quickly carried us out of danger.</p>

<p>I could not help speculating what the crowd
would have said and done had they known the
mission on which we were bent, and the grim cause
which had brought us two together upon that
strange ride.</p>

<p>We reached his house in safety, and as the driver
reined up his panting horses I braced myself for the
final trial of nerves.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>&#8220;Remember my oath,&#8221; I whispered, as together
we mounted the steps side by side. My fear was
that as soon as he found himself once more in the
midst of his men, his courage would return sufficiently
for him to at least put up some show of fight.</p>

<p>Had he done so, he must have beaten me. Despite
my oath and all my fiercely spoken threats, I
had no intention of shooting him. It was all just
bluff on my part; but I had acted well enough to
prevent his having any suspicion of this. He was
convinced that I was in grim, deadly earnest, and
that his life hung on a thread, and he was poltroon
enough to buy it at any cost.</p>

<p>The proceedings in the house were very brief.</p>

<p>He went straight to the library and sent the man
on guard out of the room. He was as anxious to
be relieved from the menacing barrel of my revolver
as I was to get the papers and be off.</p>

<p>In silence he opened the safe and after a hurried
search found the papers and offered them to me.
They made a somewhat bulky package.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shew me,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>He opened the package and held each while I
ran my eye over it; and then folded them together
in the portfolio and handed it to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;One thing more. A written authority from you
to me in open terms. Just write &#8216;The bearer is
acting by my authority,&#8217; signed and sealed officially.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without hesitation he obeyed and wrote what I
wanted.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>&#8220;You will accompany me to the sleigh,&#8221; I said,
as I pocketed the paper.</p>

<p>We left the room together arm in arm just as we
had entered it, passed the men in the hall and down
the steps to the sleigh.</p>

<p>Then I saw trouble.</p>

<p>Some distance up the street a patrol of mounted
police was riding toward us at the walk, and in an
instant I perceived the danger this spelt for me.</p>

<p>So did Bremenhof. The sight seemed to rouse
his long dormant courage. He pushed me away
from him, jumped back, and called in a loud ringing
tone for help.</p>

<p>The police came running out from his house,
the patrol pricked up their horses; and as I sprang
into the sleigh, the street seemed suddenly alive
with men.</p>

<p>My driver knew his business, however. The
horses he had were spirited and full of blood, and
in a moment we were rattling along at full speed,
the bells ringing and jingling furiously, the driver
shouting lusty warnings, and the sleigh jumping
and jolting so that I had to grip tight to save myself
from being thrown out.</p>

<p>The patrol pulled up to speak with Bremenhof,
and, as we dashed round a corner, I saw him mount
one of the horses and come clattering after us, leading
the rest in hot pursuit.</p>

<p>But we had a good start by that time, and my
driver, guiding his team with rare skill and judgment,
made a dozen quick turns through short<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
streets. This prevented our pursuers from spurring
their animals to the gallop, kept them in doubt as to
the direction we had taken, and thus minimized their
advantage of saddle over harness.</p>

<p>To that man&#339;uvre was due our success in evading
immediate capture.</p>

<p>Doubtful of ultimate success in such a chase,
however, I proposed to the driver to pull up and
let me get away on foot.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Count is close here,&#8221; he replied, to my
great surprise; and after we had raced along in this
fashion for some ten minutes, I saw Volna and
Ladislas waiting at a corner. The driver pulled up,
and they jumped in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sergius was to look for us here,&#8221; said Ladislas,
in explanation. &#8220;What has happened?&#8221;</p>

<p>I told him briefly as we continued the flight.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall get away,&#8221; he said confidently. &#8220;Sergius
knows his work. He has not his equal in
Warsaw,&#8221; and it looked at that moment as though
his confidence was well grounded.</p>

<p>Volna was very calm, but the glances she kept
casting behind bore witness to her anxiety.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you are right,&#8221; I replied to Ladislas;
&#8220;but you should not have come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Were we likely to desert you, Mr. Anstruther?&#8221;
asked Volna.</p>

<p>&#8220;You could do no good, and the risk is too
great.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We had to know what happened to you. I
could not rest.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>I understood then the meaning of her former
words. It was never too late for her last desperate
sacrifice should our plan go wrong. &#8220;The risk is
too serious,&#8221; I repeated.</p>

<p>It was churlish to reproach them for an act which
sprang from a chivalrous regard for my safety;
but they had made a grave mistake. They had
rendered my escape much more difficult.</p>

<p>Had I been alone I could have left the sleigh and
made off on foot. The crowd in some of the streets
was thick enough for me to have lost myself among
them and so to have got away unnoticed. But with
three of us together the case was different. There
was nothing for it but to remain in the sleigh and
trust to the driver&#8217;s skill to save us.</p>

<p>Presently the good fortune which had befriended
me changed. Turning into one of the side streets
we found the roadway partially blocked by some
heavy drays. We had to pull up, and moments,
precious to us beyond count, were lost as we waited
for room to be made for us to squeeze through.</p>

<p>The street was a long one without a turning, and
before we reached the end of it, Volna, who was
looking back, gave a cry of dismay.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are in sight,&#8221; she said; and we saw Bremenhof
and three or four men spurring after us at
full speed.</p>

<p>Ladislas called to Sergius, who lashed his horses
and redoubled his efforts to make up some of the
time we had lost.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are we going?&#8221; I asked.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>&#8220;To Madame Drakona. Three miles out on the
Smolna road.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sergius began his tactics of sharp turns again,
swinging round corner after corner at a reckless
speed. But beyond proving his great skill as a
daring whip, he did little good.</p>

<p>Bremenhof began to gain fast upon us, and at
length came within pistol range.</p>

<p>He called to us to surrender, and when we paid
no heed, his men fired at us. Volna winced and
shrank at the shots; but we were not hit and held
on grimly.</p>

<p>It could not last much longer, however; and just
when things were looking bad enough from behind,
a big dray heavily laden came lumbering toward us,
blocking the whole street.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must give it up,&#8221; said Ladislas.</p>

<p>But Sergius saw a desperate chance and took it.
The heavy vehicle was making for a narrow side
street. To wait until it had turned would have
brought Bremenhof upon us, and the leading horses
of the waggon were actually turning into the side
street when Sergius, with wonderful skill, and at
the risk of all our lives, swung round into the opening.
Our horses and sleigh cannoned against the
leaders, the sleigh gave a dangerous lurch, was
thrown on to the one roller, all but toppled over,
and then righted. It was touch and go; but the luck
was ours, and on we went.</p>

<p>We even gained a little by the mishap, for our
pursuers being unable to check their horses in time,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
were carried past the street opening, while the
heavy dray blocked the road and delayed them.</p>

<p>But the advantage was too slight to hold out hope
of escape.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must leave the sleigh and take our chance
on foot,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>Ladislas called an order to the driver, and when
we had traversed half the length of the street and
Bremenhof and his men had just passed the dray,
Sergius pulled his animals on to their haunches at
the mouth of an alley, waited while we jumped to
the ground, and then dashed away again at the same
reckless speed.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can get through here to the street of St.
Gregory, and may find shelter,&#8221; said Ladislas, leading
the way through the alley in a last desperate
dash for freedom.</p>

<p>Then again fortune did us an ill turn. Half way
through the place Volna caught her foot and fell.
She was up again in a moment, but limped badly.
She had twisted her ankle in the fall.</p>

<p>Ladislas and I put each an arm under hers, and
in this way made such haste as we could.</p>

<p>But the delay served to bring our pursuers close
upon us; and they came running at top speed after
us, making three yards to our one.</p>

<p>Again capture seemed inevitable. Then recalling
the incident of earlier in the day at the house in the
Place of St. John, I repeated it.</p>

<p>I fired my revolver in the air. &#8220;The police! The
police!&#8221; I shouted. &#8220;A rescue! A rescue!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>It served us in good stead. The noise brought
men and women rushing in alarm and curiosity
from the houses on both sides of the alley, while
many others ran in from the street beyond. Seeing
our plight they cheered us and swarmed between
Bremenhof&#8217;s party and us, blocking and hampering
them so that we reached the end in safety.</p>

<p>The outlet to the alley was a narrow archway.
Room was made for us to pass, and we gained the
street while our pursuers were struggling and fighting
to force their way through after us.</p>

<p>But again the respite seemed only to mock us.</p>

<p>We ran out only to find ourselves on the skirts
of an ugly tumult. A short distance to our left
down the street of St. Gregory, a fight was in progress
between a considerable body of police and a
crowd of strikers, and just as we emerged from the
alley the police were getting the upper hand and
the strikers were beginning to waver.</p>

<p>Some one raised the cry that a large body of
police were coming through the alley, and the
crowd, afraid of being caught between two fires,
gave way and came streaming toward us followed
by the police.</p>

<p>At that juncture Bremenhof and his men succeeded
in reaching the street and joined the other
police in a vigorous attack upon the crowd.</p>

<p>The situation was again critically perilous for us.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIX<br />


<small>IN THE STREET OF ST. GREGORY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE luck seemed to be dead against us. Volna
could scarcely put her foot to the ground and,
although she struggled gamely to continue the flight,
Ladislas and I were all but carrying her.</p>

<p>The crowd went streaming past us as we could
make only the slowest progress; and as no vehicle
of any sort was in sight, capture appeared inevitable.</p>

<p>Volna perceived this and begged us to leave her.
&#8220;It will be far better for me to be arrested alone
than for all three to be taken; and you see it is
hopeless now that the three can escape.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not going,&#8221; said Ladislas.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Anstruther, you have the proofs that will
free my mother. If you will escape and destroy
them, she will be safe. Please go.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a shrewd plea.</p>

<p>I took out the papers and held them toward
Ladislas. &#8220;You go. I can trust my friends to get
me out of any mess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; to-day&#8217;s business with Bremenhof is too
serious for that,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;Besides, this is
my affair. Go, Robert. It is sheer madness for
you to remain. You can do no good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If my mother is safe, Mr. Anstruther, I do not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
care. For her sake as well as your own, get those
papers away.&#8221;</p>

<p>I glanced round and saw Bremenhof was fast
forcing his way to us through the scattering crowd.</p>

<p>&#8220;We may get a sleigh or a carriage at the end of
the street there,&#8221; I said; and without more ado, I
picked Volna up in my arms and ran up the street
with her.</p>

<p>The crowd cheered us lustily. Some one recognized
Ladislas, rallied the flying crowd and succeeded
in reforming them again when we had
passed.</p>

<p>Perceiving this, and recognizing that we might
in this way escape even at the last moment, Bremenhof,
hoping to awe the crowd, ordered the police
to draw their revolvers. At first the people fell
back, but encouraged by the cries of the man who
had constituted himself the leader they formed
again, and answered the order to clear the way with
yells and shouts of defiance.</p>

<p>Losing his head Bremenhof told his men to fire.
A ragged volley of pistol shots followed and two
men fell wounded.</p>

<p>For an instant a solemn hush fell; and then rose
such a wild fierce yell of rage and fury from the mob
that the police drew back in suspense.</p>

<p>The two parties stood facing one another for a
breathing space. Then some one threw a heavy
stone and struck one of the police in the face. Two
of his comrades near him fired in return. A volley
of stones was hurled by the crowd, and a wild and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
desperate conflict was waged over the bodies of the
fallen men.</p>

<p>People came running to the scene from all directions.
Many of them were armed with clubs,
hatchets, crowbars, and such weapons as could be
snatched up in a hurry. Some carried revolvers;
and, as we stood awhile, unable for the press of the
people to get forward, a fierce hand-to-hand fight
was waged. Hard blows were given on either side,
shots were exchanged, and blood flowed freely, until
the police were beaten back in their turn and had
to fly.</p>

<p>The mob whooped and yelled and halloed savagely
over their victory, and pressed forward hot
and eager to wreak their anger upon the flying men.</p>

<p>The triumph was short-lived, however. Into the
street from the end for which we were making
swung a large force of troops to the rescue of the
police.</p>

<p>I drew Volna back into the doorway of a house
as they passed at the double; and the fight broke
out again this time with the advantage all against
the strikers.</p>

<p>Men fell fast, and the crowd scattered and made
for cover in the houses on either side of the street.</p>

<p>Escape for us was now impossible for the time,
for the fight raged close to the door of the house
where we had sheltered.</p>

<p>In the thick of the fight at some distance from us,
I could see Bremenhof. If he had been a coward
while we two had been alone and he believed death<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
to be close to him, he was no coward now. He was
not like the same man. Passion, or the company
of his men, gave him courage. He was everywhere,
directing his men and exposing himself fearlessly
where the fighting was hottest; and always seeking
to press forward as though in pursuit of us.</p>

<p>Fresh tactics were next adopted by the crowd.
Men who had fled from the street appeared at the
open windows of the houses and fired on the police
and troops from this vantage. Many shots told;
and to save themselves from this form of attack, the
troops began to enter the houses in their turn and
search for the armed men.</p>

<p>And all this time the press and throng of police
and strikers made escape for us impossible.</p>

<p>After a time the training of the troops and police
told; the crowds in the streets lessened; many
prisoners were taken, most of them bloodstained
with marks of the conflict; and the noise of the conflict
began to die down. But not for long.</p>

<p>The news that fighting was in progress had spread
far and wide, and a body of strikers who had been
parading the main street near were attracted to the
scene.</p>

<p>The police in their turn found themselves caught
between two hostile mobs; and the flame of fight
which had almost flickered down flared up again
more luridly and vigorously than ever.</p>

<p>The prisoners were torn from the grasp of their
captors in the moment of surprise, and hurried past
us to the rear of the fighters.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>The troops were still strong enough, however,
to make the fight even; and after the first moment
of surprise, their discipline told. They formed in
lines facing up and down the street, and settled
down with grim resolve for the deadly work before
them.</p>

<p>Then came a loud cry of &#8220;A barricade! A
barricade!&#8221;</p>

<p>In little more than a minute a couple of heavy
waggons were trundled out from a side street, and
turned over close to where we three were waiting.
Out from the houses were fetched a heterogeneous
collection of furniture&mdash;bedsteads, mattresses,
couches, chests of drawers, shop counters, chairs,
tables, anything and everything that lay to hand
was seized and brought out. Some were even hurled
from windows above. And behind the impromptu
rampart armed men crouched mad with long pent
passion, and eager to wreak vengeance upon their
enemies.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Ladislas had viewed the scene with
fast mounting distress and agitation. The deliberateness
of these last preparations for the fight seemed
to appal him. The sight of this harvest of violence
sprung from the seeds of his own revolutionary
theorizing wrung his heart. Dreaming of victory
by peaceful means, the horror of this bloodshed and
carnage goaded him to despair. His suffering was
acute.</p>

<p>Heedless of his own safety he rushed hither and
thither among those who were leading the mob, dissuading<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
them from violence and urging them to
abandon their resistance.</p>

<p>Half a dozen times when he had dashed out to
press his plea of non-resistance, I had had almost to
drag him back into safety.</p>

<p>The lull that came when the barricade was forming
gave him a fresh opportunity. In vain I told him
that nothing could stay the fight now that the
smouldering wrath of years of wrong had flamed
into the mad fury of the moment, and when the
wild passions of both sides had been roused.</p>

<p>Volna joined her voice to mine and urged him.</p>

<p>But in his frenzy of emotional remorse, he paid
no heed to us. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you see that all this horror
is the result of what I in my blindness have been
doing?&#8221; he cried. &#8220;The thought of it is torment
and the sight of it hell. Would you have me skulk
here to save my skin when an effort now may stop
further bloodshed?&#8221;</p>

<p>With that he rushed out.</p>

<p>He went first among the strikers, and we saw him
advising, arguing, urging, pleading, commanding
in turn with no effect. Those whom he addressed
listened to him at first with a measure of patience
but afterwards with shrugs, sullen looks, intolerant
gestures, and at last with stubborn, angry resentment
at his interference, or jeers and flouts according
to their humour.</p>

<p>And all this time the preparations were not stayed
a second but hurried forward with feverish haste
and vengeful lust of fight.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>At length, I saw him thrust aside roughly, almost
savagely, by one burly fellow who had been building
the barricade and now stood gripping a heavy iron
crowbar and wiping the sweat from his brow.</p>

<p>This act served as a cue for the rest. Ladislas
was passed from hand to hand, and pushed with
jibes and oaths, from the centre of the barricade to
the pavement.</p>

<p>For an instant he tried a last appeal to the men
about him; but their only reply was a jeering laugh,
half contemptuous, half angry, but wholly indifferent
to every word he uttered.</p>

<p>Just then a loud command from the officer in
charge of the troops was given and the soldiers advanced
a few paces and levelled their guns.</p>

<p>In a moment Ladislas had climbed over the barricade
and rushed forward into the space between
the troops and the mob. He ran forward with uplifted
hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;For the love of God, peace,&#8221; he cried to the
officer, his voice clear and strong above the din.
&#8220;No more blood must be shed.&#8221;</p>

<p>For an instant a silence fell upon both sides, and
all eyes were fixed upon him.</p>

<p>The next, a single shot was fired from among the
ranks of the troops.</p>

<p>Ladislas&#8217; uplifted hand dropped. He staggered,
and turned toward the mob, so that all saw by the
red mark on his white, broad forehead where the
bullet had struck him, and fell huddled up on the
road.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>It was the signal for the fight to break loose. A
wild, deep groan of execration leapt from every
throat behind the barricade, followed by shouts and
cries of defiance. His fall at the hands of the troops
had raised him to the place of martyr; and those
who had been quick to jeer him now shrieked and
yelled for vengeance upon his murderers.</p>

<p>Surely an irony of fate that he who had given his
life in the cause of peace should by his death have
loosed the wildest passion for blood.</p>

<p>A ghastly scene followed. As the soldiers charged
the barricade, the mob offered a stubborn and desperate
resistance. Many of them were shot down,
but there were others ready to take their places.
Time after time the troops reached and mounted the
barricade only to be driven back. Once they carried
it, and commenced to charge the crowd behind;
but they were outnumbered many times, and the
mob beat them, and hurled them back and pursued
them even across the barricade, inflicting serious
loss.</p>

<p>I seized that moment to run out and recover the
body of my poor friend. I found him; and as I was
carrying him out of the press of the tumult, the
troops rallied, and the tide of the fight came surging
back past me.</p>

<p>The chances of the struggle brought Bremenhof
close up. He saw me, and with a cry of anger
rushed to seize me.</p>

<p>Some of the mob had seen my effort to get Ladislas
away. One of them had stayed to help and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
was thus close at hand when the attempt was made
to capture me. Thinking that the intention was to
prevent my carrying Ladislas away, he pressed forward
and with a savage oath thrust his revolver
right in Bremenhof&#8217;s face and fired.</p>

<p>This act proved the turning point in the fight.</p>

<p>Fierce shouts of exultation went up as Bremenhof
was recognized. The strikers halted, rallied and
reformed, and they renewed the attack upon the
troops with irresistible vigour and drove them back
helter-skelter in all directions.</p>

<p>The mob had won; but at a cost which had yet
to be counted. Nor did they stay to count it. The
street resounded with whoops and yells of victory.
Flushed and sweated with their exertions, the men
were like children in their delight. They shook
hands one with another, and laughed and sang and
shouted and even danced in sheer glee.</p>

<p>They had beaten the troops; had sent them
scurrying like frightened hares to cover; they had
carried the cause of the people to triumph; they had
spilt the blood of the oppressor; and the taste of it
made them drunk with the joy of the new found
power and strength.</p>

<p>Some one started the Polish national air. The
strain was caught up and echoed by a thousand deep-toned,
tuneful voices with an impression to be remembered
to one&#8217;s dying hour.</p>

<p>A crowd came round me as I stood by the two
dead bodies.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>Bremenhof&#8217;s corpse was kicked and cursed and
spat upon, till I sickened at the sight.</p>

<p>Ladislas was lifted and borne away, with the care
and honour due to a martyr, to the strains of the
national air. The revolution had begun in terrible
earnestness; and that day&#8217;s fight was its baptism of
blood.</p>

<p>As the men bore Ladislas away, I went back to
Volna to tell her the grim news and get her away
to a place of safety.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXX<br />


<small>AFTER THE STORM</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE death of Colonel Bremenhof caused a profound
sensation; and the most varied and contradictory
reports were circulated about it.</p>

<p>The authorities branded it assassination, and
threatened the most rigorous punishment of those
whom they deemed the murderers.</p>

<p>The members of the Fraternity were charged with
responsibility for it; and were declared to have laid
a deep and far-reaching plot to destroy him as one
of the chief executive leaders of the government.</p>

<p>The strikers were jubilant over the event. He
had fallen in fair fight, they alleged, when leading
the police and soldiers to attack peaceful citizens;
and his death was hailed as triumph and encouragement
to their cause.</p>

<p>In fact almost every conceivable reason was given&mdash;except
the truth.</p>

<p>There were a few who looked a little deeper for
the cause; and among these was my old friend General
von Eckerstein.</p>

<p>Three days after the outbreak of the riots I called
to bid him good-bye, and I found him deeply impressed
and full of interested speculation about the
matter.</p>

<p>&#8220;What beats me, Bob, is what business he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
to get into the thick of a street fight,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He
must have been mad. From what I have heard, his
whole conduct that day was more than eccentric.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t it his duty, then?&#8221; I asked casually.</p>

<p>&#8220;Duty? What! To go out and fight the mob?
What do you suppose the ordinary police and soldiers
are for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He must have had some private motive then.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned on me like a flash. &#8220;What do you
mean? Do you know anything?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, nothing officially.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good Heavens! where have you been the last
few days; since you were here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you just now that I returned to the city
this midday, to see the last of my poor friend Ladislas.
He was buried about the same time as Bremenhof.
Ladislas&#8217; funeral was not nearly so imposing
a ceremony, but there was vastly more genuine
grief.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, nobody liked Bremenhof as a man; but that
so high an official should have fallen in such a way!
But you&mdash;where were you on Monday?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I stayed at the <i>Vladimir</i> on Sunday night and
left Warsaw on Monday evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And all that day?&#8221; he asked with a very sharp
look.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I was moving about in different parts of
the city.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you see that fight in the street of St.
Gregory?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, amongst other things.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>&#8220;Do you mean you know what took Bremenhof
there?&#8221;</p>

<p>I nodded. &#8220;He was after me as a matter of fact.
It&#8217;s a pretty bad tangle, but if you haven&#8217;t got your
official ears open, I&#8217;ll tell you.&#8221; I told him enough
to make the matter clear.</p>

<p>&#8220;And after that you dare to shew your face in
Warsaw? Are you mad, boy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no daring about it because there&#8217;s no
risk. There was only one man who knew me in
the affair&mdash;the police spy, Burski; and he has his
own, right enough. He was playing spy at a meeting
of the strikers on Tuesday night; and one of the
men who was in the house at the place of St. John
recognized him. He was a fellow of resource and
iron nerve, and tried to brazen it out that he was a
Fraternity man. But he failed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They lynched him then and there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The infernal villains!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If it comes to that Bremenhof, who was buried
to-day with full military honours, wasn&#8217;t much to
boast of.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re going to turn revolutionary you&#8217;d
better get out of the city and be off home. Luck
like yours won&#8217;t last, boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going. I&#8217;ve done nothing except checkmate
a scoundrel. Given the same circumstances, I&#8217;d
try it again.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at me with a half whimsical smile.
&#8220;Where is she, Bob?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>&#8220;Not so far from Warsaw as I hope she soon
will be, General.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You got her out of the city then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, without much difficulty. When the
crowd got the upper hand in the street fight it was
easy for us to get away. I drove with her to the
place where Madame Drakona had been sent. Then
I hurried to the <i>Vladimir</i> and put on the police
uniform which Burski had brought me. That,
coupled with the special authority I got out of
Bremenhof and helped by a blunt discourteous
official manner, made things easy. I could have
taken a train load of women out of Warsaw. Two
were a mere detail.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you understand the fearful risk you&#8217;ve
run?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One doesn&#8217;t always stop to consider that.
Things have to be done and one does them first
and thinks afterwards. Besides, I had a good
object.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; He asked this very
curtly.</p>

<p>I smiled. &#8220;It was in the cause of freedom.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the cause of fiddlesticks. What&#8217;s Poland&#8217;s
freedom to you, that you should risk your life for
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>He started and his eyes brightened meaningly.
&#8220;Oh, I see. The freedom of the girl, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it a good enough cause for me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you think so,&#8221; he said drily. &#8220;Are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
you in a fit state now to take an old diplomat&#8217;s
advice?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; if I agree with it, of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, of course. Well, it&#8217;s this. Get out of Warsaw
and out of Russia, and stay out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t I come to bid you good-bye? Give
me credit for something. I&#8217;m going by the next
train.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>

<p>I laughed. &#8220;I like the rural districts of Poland.
I&#8217;m going first to Solden. Do you know the neighbourhood?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Solden? What in the name of&mdash;&mdash;oh, is she
there?&#8221;</p>

<p>I nodded. &#8220;At Kervatje, a few miles&#8217; drive from
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the police of Solden know you both. They
brought you here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is nothing against either of us now.
Bremenhof&#8217;s death has made all the difference. The
evidence against Madame Drakona has been destroyed,
and the charge against her daughter was
never made officially. There&#8217;s no one now to
make it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Arrests are being made wholesale, boy, with
or without charges, in consequence of his death.
Where are the brother and sister?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, and I daren&#8217;t make any inquiries.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, there <i>is</i> something you daren&#8217;t do, then?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
I don&#8217;t like the thing, Bob, and that&#8217;s the truth.
Look here, I&#8217;m going through to Berlin to-morrow;
stay here till then and travel with me. I shall
know you&#8217;re out of mischief then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should like it but&mdash;well, the fact is, you see,
I shan&#8217;t be travelling alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed drily. &#8220;As bad as that, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, if you call it bad. I don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are your papers in order? Your passports?&#8221;</p>

<p>I shook my head. &#8220;My own is, but not the
rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you want it worded?&#8221; he asked with
another grin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the usual way, whatever that is,&#8221; I said a
little sheepishly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Robert Anstruther and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Laugh away. Can you help me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give it me. Even I don&#8217;t know how a man
carries his mother-in-law on his own passport.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a bit awkward; but I don&#8217;t want a hitch
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, boy. I&#8217;ll stretch a point for you.
I&#8217;ll go by way of Cracow and will pick you up at
Solden to-morrow. I&#8217;m travelling special, and you
shall all go through in my saloon;&#8221; and scarcely
waiting to listen to my thanks he hurried me off
to the station, sending his secretary with me to
make sure that no difficulties were raised about my
departure.</p>

<p>At Solden I found Volna in a sleigh waiting for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
me. Her face lighted and she welcomed me with
a glad smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;You wonder to see me; but I was so anxious I
could not stay at Kervatje.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have very little news.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think it was only the news?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What else?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bob!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re getting quite pat with that name, now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Peggy had to learn it, you see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Volna?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Volna felt like rushing off to Warsaw when
that train was so late,&#8221; she replied earnestly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I like that answer; but there was no cause for
anxiety, I&#8217;m glad to say. Our troubles are over.
To-morrow afternoon we shall be in Cracow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had a brother once who used to say that,&#8221; she
said, with a laugh and a glance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sorry you&#8217;ve lost him?&#8221;</p>

<p>She answered by slipping her hand into my arm
and nestling a little closer to me. We sat for a time
in the sympathetic silence of mutual happiness and
perfect understanding, listening to the rhythmic
music of the sleigh bells as the three horses glided
rapidly over the snow.</p>

<p>Then I told her of my old friend&#8217;s promise to see
us safely to Cracow in his saloon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will there be any one else there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Some of his staff, perhaps.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be a little trying,&#8221; she said, with a show
of dismay.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As if you didn&#8217;t know. Think of the ordeal for
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve faced much worse things bravely
enough. Besides, you won&#8217;t be alone: You&#8217;ll have
your&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bob!&#8221; she interposed quickly, with a lovely
blush.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your mother with you. Mayn&#8217;t I say that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You were not going to say that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What was I going to say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Volna has all Peggy&#8217;s instincts, remember.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I challenge you to say what you think I
meant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not in a fighting mood to accept challenges.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I dare you to say it, then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be a coward, Bob.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll say it then. You&#8217;ll have your&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bob.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s quite true. If you keep your promise of
two days ago, and Father Ambrose does his duty
to-morrow. I shall be&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the way to Cracow; do you recognize
it?&#8221; she cried quickly, as we reached the forked
roads of which Father Ambrose had told us.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the way a brother and sister went; but
this one to-morrow a man and his&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How lucky we were not to have the snow that
time, weren&#8217;t we?&#8221; she broke in again.</p>

<p>&#8220;That wasn&#8217;t the real luck in my eyes. My luck<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
was when I lost my sister and found in her place

<p>She held up her hand, laughing and blushing
vividly. &#8220;If you do, I&#8217;ll&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll wait until Father Ambrose has said
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shan&#8217;t mind then. Oh, Bob, won&#8217;t it be
lovely!&#8221; and she laughed and squeezed my arm,
and pressed her head against my shoulder.</p>

<p>All of which no doubt sounds very much like
foolishness. It goes to shew that we were very
young of course, very really in love, and very happy
after our strenuous time. As happy indeed as any
two young people could wish to be who were to be
made man and wife within a few hours. In those
hours a deal of happiness is just so much foolishness.</p>

<p>In one thing Volna was wrong. It was no ordeal
that awaited her on the journey with the General to
Cracow.</p>

<p>At her first glance he fell before her; and by the
time we reached Cracow he was almost as much in
love with her as I was.</p>

<p>During the journey he shewed such tact, too. He
devoted most of his time to Volna&#8217;s mother; and
having told her he had learnt that Katinka and Paul
had left Warsaw and gone to Vienna, he kept her
talking most of the time in one corner of the saloon,
while Volna and I were alone in another.</p>

<p>When we parted at Cracow he took Volna&#8217;s two
hands and pressed them, and smiled as he said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>
tenderly, and very earnestly: &#8220;I can understand
Bob now that I&#8217;ve seen you. You were just made
to be loved as I know he loves you, my dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>And to me, drawing me aside: &#8220;I told you yesterday
your luck wouldn&#8217;t last, boy. I take that
back. I pray God it may; and that you may always
be worthy of it. Good-bye, boy.&#8221;</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
